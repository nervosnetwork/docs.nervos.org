# Tutorial Examples

The dApp examples are created by [offckb](https://github.com/ckb-ecofund/offckb) templates. You can switch different networks by exporting `NETWORK` env var.

```sh
export NETWORK=testnet # or testnet, mainnet
```

On devnet, use [`offckb`](https://github.com/ckb-ecofund/offckb) to start a local blockchain first:

```sh
npm install -g offckb

# start the devnet
offckb node 
```
