## Debug With CKB-Debugger

Debugging Scripts on the Nervos CKB can be challenging without the right tools. We recommend using the [CKB-Debugger](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-standalone-debugger), a powerful standalone command-line tool designed for off-chain Script development. With CKB-Debugger, you can efficiently identify and resolve issues in your Scripts, ensuring smooth execution and optimal performance.

### Install

Install CKB-Debugger using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo). We recommend using **≥v0.113.0**.

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-standalone-debugger ckb-debugger
```

On **MacOS**, the `protoc` binary must be available to compile `ckb-vm-pprof-converter`. This can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install protobuf
```

### Examples

### 1. Execute Transactions Locally

To download an on-chain transaction from the network and execute it locally, use [ckb-cli](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-cli):

```sh
$ ckb-cli --url https://mainnet.ckbapp.dev/rpc mock-tx dump --tx-hash 0x5f0a4162622daa0e50b2cf8f49bc6ece22d1458d96fc12a094d6f074d6adbb55 --output-file mock_tx.json
```

Then execute the Lock Script or Type Script in the transaction:

```sh
$ ckb-debugger --tx-file mock_tx.json --cell-index 0 --cell-type input --script-group-type lock

Run result: 0
Total cycles consumed: 1697297(1.6M)
Transfer cycles: 12680(12.4K), running cycles: 1684617(1.6M)
```

To replace the Script in the transaction with a new version of the lock, use the `--bin` option:

```c
// always_failure.c
int main() {
    return 1;
}
```

```sh
$ ckb-debugger --tx-file mock_tx.json --cell-index 0 --cell-type input --script-group-type lock --bin always_failure

Run result: 1
Total cycles consumed: 1706(1.7K)
Transfer cycles: 764, running cycles: 942
```

### 2. Debug Failed Transactions

In most case, you want to debug failed transactions instead of successful ones to find out the reasons for the failures.

First, dump the transaction into a local file. Assume you are using the [Lumos SDK](/docs/sdk-and-devtool/lumos) to build the transaction,
you can convert the `txSkeleton` type into a JSON file:

```js
> let txJson = rpc.paramsFormatter.toRawTransaction(lumos.helpers.createTransactionFromSkeleton(txSkeleton))
> fs.writeFileSync('failed-tx.json', JSON.stringify(txJson, null, 2))
```

Next, convert the `failed-tx.json` to a dump transaction with context info using [ckb-transaction-dumper](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-transaction-dumper):

```bash
$ ckb-transaction-dumper -t failed-tx.json -o full-failed-tx.json -r <mainnet/testnet/devnet RPC url>
```

Then, debug the Script. Remember to replace the `cell-type` and `cell-index` with the actual values in the following command:

```bash
$ ckb-debugger --tx-file full-failed-tx.json --cell-index 0 --cell-type output --script-group-type type
```

### 3. Debug Script with GDB

You can debug Scripts using GDB with `ckb-debugger`. Assume the Script is in `fib.c`:

```c title='fib.c'
int fib(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    }
}

int main() {
    if (fib(5) != 5) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

After compiling `fib.c` to RISC-V binary `fib`, we can debug this Script in GDB mode:

```bash
$ ckb-debugger --mode gdb --gdb-listen 127.0.0.1:9999 --bin fib
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb fib

$ (gdb) target remote 127.0.0.1:9999
$ (gdb) b fib
$ (gdb) c
    Breakpoint 1, fib (n=5) at fib.c:2
```

At the Breakpoint 1, we see that `fib (n=5)` at `fib.c:2`.

### 4. Debug Script with GDB in VSCode

Script debugging can be done in an IDE using `ckb-debugger`, which supports a `gdbserver` mode enabled with `--mode=gdb`. VSCode allows debugging via debugger extensions. Below, we explain how to use [NativeDebug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.debug) and [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) for CKB Script debugging.

For testing, refer to [this project](https://github.com/joii2020/ckb-llvm-examples).

This guide uses **Rust** for demonstration. Similar principles apply to other languages as wel.

#### Preparation

- `ckb-debugger` supports older versions of GDB. For LLDB, version 18 or higher is required (older versions lack robust RISC-V support).
- For CodeLLDB, ensure the version is at least `v1.11`.
- For LLDB, use `ckb-debugger` version `0.118` or above.

:::note

Compilation may involve some LLVM commands. Just ensure the LLVM version is not too old.

:::

#### Compilation

:::note
If your project was created using `ckb-script-templates`, the following steps are likely already done. You can skip this section.
:::

Due to CKB's memory constraints, by default, Scripts are compiled in Release mode without debug information. To enable debugging, update your `Cargo.toml` file with these settings for the release build:

```toml
[profile.release]
overflow-checks = true
strip = false
codegen-units = 1
debug = true
```

After compilation, use the following commands to prepare the Scripts for deployment and debugging:

```shell
cp <script_file> <script_file>.debug
llvm-objcopy --strip-debug --strip-all <script_file>
```

This produces two files:

- `<script_file>`: The actual Script for testing and release.
- `<script_file>.debug`: A debug version with symbols. It is for debugging only due to the large size impossible to be executed as a Script.

#### VSCode Configuration

VSCode tasks are configured in `tasks.json`. Here you have two tasks: one to start `ckb-debugger`, the other to stop it.

```json
{
    "label": "StartDbg-Rust",
    "isBackground": true,
    "type": "process",
    "command": "ckb-debugger",
    "args": [
        "--bin=rust/build/release/ckb-c1.debug",
        "--mode=gdb",
        "--gdb-listen=127.0.0.1:8000"
    ],
    "options": {
        "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}"
    },
},
{
    "label": "StopCkbDebugger",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "killall ckb-debugger || true"
}
```

Explanation of the fields:

- `label` : Customizable task name
- `StartDbg-Rust`: Background-enabled task (`isBackground` set to true)
- `--bin` : Path to the Script file
- `—gdb-listen` : Listening address and port (e.g., `8000` in this example, but it can be different).
- `StopCkbDebugger`: Stops the `ckb-debugger` after a debug session. This is needed because `ckb-debugger` doesn’t exit automatically after debugging, but waits for the next execution instead.

:::note

If multiple Scripts are debugged simultaneously, stopping one session may terminate others.

:::

### 5. Profiling Data with Flamegraph Visualization Tool

Use `ckb-debugger` to profile data for flamegraph visualization:

```sh
$ ckb-debugger --bin fib --pprof fib.pprof
```

Install [inferno](https://crates.io/crates/inferno) to conver the profile data:

```sh
$ cargo install inferno
```

Then, pass the file created by ckb-debugger into inferno-flamegraph:

```sh
$ cat fib.pprof | inferno-flamegraph > fib.svg
```

Open the resulting SVG file to view the flamegraph:

## Debug With Native Simulator

CKB Scripts follow the RISC-V specification and include APIs related to [VM syscalls](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0009-vm-syscalls/0009-vm-syscalls.md), making them incompatible to execute on common devices. Previously, many projects addressed this limitation by isolating the code unrelated to VM syscalls into separate libraries for development and testing. Some even implemented a rudimentary version of VM syscalls.

Native Simulator addresses this issue, allowing for compilation and debugging on the native platform, as well as contract-related APIs simulation. For the code unrelated to VM syscalls and thus not executable on RISC-V, it can be compiled into a native executable for the host platform and debugged, while the VM syscalls part is managed by the [ckb-x64-simulator](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-x64-simulator), which simulates the required APIs. With both parts are covered, you can proceed with project management and testing. These functionalities have been integrated into `ckb-script-templates` and `ckb-testtool`.

Below, we explain how to incorporate the Native Simulator into existing projects via `ckb-script-templates` or manually.

### Preparation

- The `ckb-std` version must be at least 0.16.3 (While the support was introduced since v0.16.1, but the features were not fully developed.).
- Testing with `ckb-testtool` is recommended to save effort. For new projects, consider using `ckb-script-templates` for project management. For project already under development, evaluate the situation and decide on a case-by-case basis.

### Create with ckb-script-templates

For projects created with the latest version of `ckb-script-templates`, initialize Native Simulator with the following command:

```shell
make generate-native-simulator CRATE=<Existing Script>
```

where `CRATE` must be an existing Script.

Once created, run `make build` to compile. If custom code causes errors, use `#[cfg(feature = "native-simulator")]` to handle them.

### Create Manually

If `ckb-script-templates` is unavailable, manually integrate the Native Simulator as follows:

#### Step 1. Set Up the Project

a. Add a [`lib.rs`](http://lib.rs) file in the Scrip's `src` directory with the following content:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "native-simulator"), no_std)]
#![allow(special_module_name)]
#![allow(unused_attributes)]
#[cfg(feature = "native-simulator")]
mod main;
#[cfg(feature = "native-simulator")]
pub use main::program_entry;
```

b. Add a `native-simulator` feature in the `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
native-simulator = ["ckb-std/native-simulator"]
```

c. Update [`main.rs`](http://main.rs) to conditionally enable `no_std`, `no_main`, `ckb_std::entry!`, `(program_entry)`, and `ckb_std::default_alloc!()` for `native-simulator`:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(any(feature = "native-simulator", test)), no_std)]
#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_main)]

#[cfg(any(feature = "native-simulator", test))]
extern crate alloc;

#[cfg(not(any(feature = "native-simulator", test)))]
ckb_std::entry!(program_entry);
#[cfg(not(any(feature = "native-simulator", test)))]
ckb_std::default_alloc!();

pub fn program_entry() -> i8 {
    ...
    0
}
```

#### Step 2. Create and Configure a Library

Create a Rust lib `<contract_name>-sim` under `./native-simulator/`. There is no naming convention required here, it's just a recommended format. Add this lib to `Cargo.toml`.

a. Include `ckb-std` and the Script in Step 1 as dependencies in `Cargo.toml`, with the `native-simulator` feature enabled, and ensure the lib type is `cdylib`:

```toml
[dependencies]
contract = { path = "../../contracts/contract", features = ["native-simulator"] }
ckb-std = { version = "0.16.3", features = ["native-simulator"] }
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

b. Add the following code into lib.rs：

```rust
ckb_std::entry_simulator!(<contrace_name>::program_entry);
```

#### Step 3. Compile For Native Platform

Compile the code for the native platform. Address compatibility issues using `#[cfg(not(any(feature = "native-simulator", test)))]`.

#### Step 4. Debug and Develop

Once the project is setup, use `ckb-testtool` (version 0.13.1 or higher) for testing. Refer to [this example](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-x64-simulator/blob/main/tests/tests/src/tests.rs#L19).

The newly added `Context::add_contract_dir()` function allows you to set up the Script and the Native Simulator directory.

To facilitate usage, add a native-simulator feature into the `tests`:

```toml
native-simulator = [ "ckb-testtool/native-simulator" ]
```

#### Step 5. Compile Script and Simulator Before Use

When the `native-simulator` feature is enabled, the Script will use the Native Simulator. At this point, you can use IDE debugging tools to set breakpoints within the Script for debugging.

### How It Works

For the Script, `ckb-std` uses [ckb-x64-simulator](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-x64-simulator/tree/main) to simulate on-chain data. This simulator receives the file paths of the transaction data required via two environment variables: `CKB_TX_FILE` and `CKB_RUNNING_SETUP`, where:

- `CKB_TX_FILE` contains transaction information
- `CKB_RUNNING_SETUP` contains miscellaneous data related to the transaction

One key item in `CKB_RUNNING_SETUP` is `native_binaries`. It maps the Script to its corresponding Native Simulator, primarily used in [exec](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0034-vm-syscalls-2/0034-vm-syscalls-2.md#exec) and [spawn](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0050-vm-syscalls-3/0050-vm-syscalls-3.md#spawn).

In the `native-simulator`, `ckb-std` provides a macro: [`entry_simulator`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-std/blob/master/src/entry.rs#L64) (similar to `entry`). This macro exports two C functions: `__ckb_std_main` and `__set_script_info`, as shown below:

```toml
unsafe extern "C" fn __ckb_std_main(
            argc: core::ffi::c_int,
            // Arg is the same as *const c_char ABI wise.
            argv: *const $crate::env::Arg,
        ) -> i8 { ... }
unsafe extern "C" fn __set_script_info(
            ptr: *mut core::ffi::c_void,
            tx_ctx_id: u64,
            proc_ctx_id: u64,
        ) { ... }
```

where:

- `__ckb_std_main`: the entry function. When executed, it dynamically loads the lib and runs this function. The transaction information of the Script is passed through the two above-mentioned environment variables.
- `__set_script_info`: responsible for passing the global state necessary for `exec` and `spawn`.

:::Attention

- The separate crate `$crate::env::Arg` is used to prevent project complexity, as combining these two functions would complicate maintenance.
- For developers wishing to use this feature, we recommend to use `ckb-testtool` for development and testing to simplify work.
- Script and Native Simulator are bound one-to-one. If `ckb-testtool` cannot locate the corresponding Native Simulator, it will automatically execute the Script's results.
- Native Simulator is exclusively for debugging and cannot execute in CKB-VM. Be mindful when deploying Script on-chain.
- Native Simulator simulates Script execution, but cannot guarantee identical result to a real environment. Therefore, it should be used only for development.

## Which Method to Choose

These two debugging methods have their pros and cons. We recommend choosing based on the stage of your project (new or in maintenance) and your priority (compatibility or efficiency).

| Feature       | CKB-debugger + VSCode                                                                                                                                        | Native-Simulator                                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pros**      | - High compatibility, ready for earlier projects. <br /> - No discrepancies after deployment because CKB-VM and on-chain data retrieval are shared with CKB. | - High execution efficiency. <br /> - Advanced debugging tools (e.g., memory inspection). |
| **Cons**      | - Subtle differences from actual script execution. <br /> - Requires a recent version `ckb-std` and some additional code.                                    |                                                                                           |
| **Ideal for** | Projects in maintenance mode where minimal disruption is desired.                                                                                            | New projects or projects undergoing major modification that require extensive debugging.  |
| **Tips**      | - Use with `ckb-script-templates` and `ckb-testtool`. <br /> - Avoid enabling Native Simulator in CI (Continuous Integration) testing.                       |                                                                                           |
