title: VM Known Issues

CKB offers a high degree of flexibility in Script referencing. By choosing between [`data hash` and `type hash`](/docs/tech-explanation/data-type-diff), developers and users can decide whether to lock a Script to a specific VM version or allow it to track upgrades over time.

While this flexibility enables both immutable and upgradable designs, it also places responsibility on users and developers to understand the characteristics of each VM version. Certain versions may have known issues that could affect Script behavior or security.

This page discloses known issues for each VM version so you can:

- Assess risks before deploying or interacting with a Script.
- Avoid unexpected behavior by being aware of edge cases, performance changes, or vulnerabilities.
