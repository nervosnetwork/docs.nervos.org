As a C-language contract, ckb-js-vm uses a Makefile to manage its build process and relies on LLVM 18 by default (Theoretically support higher versions). Developers need to install the dependencies in advance. (LLVM 18 already supports RISC-V compilation, so the official release works.)

```shell
git submodule update --init
make all
```

The contract binary is in `build/ckb-js-vm`. The `build/ckb-js-vm.debug` binary contains debug symbols and can be used for debugging.

### Reproducible Build

When deploying an on-chain script, it's essential to build it from scratch. A key requirement during this process is
ensuring that different builds of the same source code produce identical binaries - this is known as a "reproducible
build."

You can achieve this with ckb-js-vm using the following command:

```bash
bash reproducible_build.sh
```

### Deployment

The script has been deployed on the testnet with these parameters:
