# IPC

As mentioned in the previous chapter on [JS Syscalls](./js-api-syscalls), `ckb-js-vm` supports [Spawn](../spawn-cross-script-calling). Building on top of Spawn, we implemented an additional abstraction layer called [IPC](../ckb-ipc), which also provides a similar set of APIs for use in JavaScript.

(While using JavaScript as a server is technically supported, the overhead of `ckb-js-vm` is significant, so we do **not** recommend doing so.)

## `spawnCellServer`

Spawns a new IPC server process using the provided code hash and hash type.

### Syntax

```typescript
export function spawnCellServer(
  codeHash: ArrayBuffer,
  hashType: number,
  argv: string[]
): [Pipe, Pipe];
```

### Parameters

- `codeHash`: The code hash to search for (must be 32 bytes)
- `hashType`: The type of hash to search for (type or data)
- `argv`: An array of strings representing the arguments to pass to the new process.

### Return

A tuple of two `Pipe` objects representing the read and write pipes for the parent process, or throws an `Error` if an error occurs.

## spawnServer

Same to spawnCellServer, but spawn from a specified source

### Syntax

```typescript
export function spawnServer(
  index: number,
  source: SourceType,
  argv: string[],
): [Pipe, Pipe] {
```

### Parameters

- `index` : The index of the source to spawn from
- `source` : The type of source (use SOURCE\_\* constants)
- `argv`: An array of strings representing the arguments to pass to the new process.

### Return

A tuple of two `Pipe` objects representing the read and write pipes for the parent process, or throws an `Error` if an error occurs.

## runServer

Runs the server with the provided service implementation.
This function listens for incoming requests, processes them using the provided service, and sends back the responses. It uses the inherited file descriptors for communication.

### Syntax

```typescript
export function runServer(handler: RequestHandler): void;
```

### Parameters

`handler` : The service implementation that handles the requests and generates the responses.

### Return

Never returns unless an error occurs, in which case it throws an `Error`.

## Channel

The `Channel` class facilitates IPC communication between a client and a server.
It handles the transmission of requests from the client to the server and the reception of responses from the server to the client.

## Channel.constructor

Creates a new Channel instance

### Syntax

```typescript
constructor(reader: Read, writer: Write);
```

### Parameters

- `reader` : Responsible for reading data from the channel
- `writer` : Responsible for writing data to the channel

## Channel.execute

Executes the server loop, processing incoming requests and sending responses.

### Syntax

```typescript
execute(handler: RequestHandler): void
```

### Parameters

`handler` : A service that handles requests and generates responses

## Channel.call

Sends a request to the server and waits for a response.

This method handles the complete request-response cycle by sending the request to the server and then waiting for and returning the server's response.

### Syntax

```typescript
call(req: RequestPacket): ResponsePacket
```

### Parameters

- `req` : The request packet to send to the server

### Return

The response packet received from the server

## Channel.sendErrorCode

Sends an error code to the client

### Syntax

```typescript
sendErrorCode(errorCode: number): void
```

### Parameters

- `errorCode` - The error code to send

## RequestHandler

Interface for a service that can handle requests and generate responses

### Syntax

```typescript
export interface RequestHandler {
  serve(req: RequestPacket): ResponsePacket;
}
```
