In this section, we will introduce some background and useful security tips for ckb-js-vm.

### Stack and Heap Memory

For normal native C programs, there is no method to control the stack size. However, QuickJS provides this capability
through its `JS_SetMaxStackSize` function. This is a critical feature to prevent stack/heap collisions.

Before explaining our memory organization design, let's understand the memory layout of ckb-vm, which follows these rules:

- Total memory is 4M
- From address 0 to the address specified by symbol `_end`, there are ELF sections (.data, .rss, .text, etc.)
- The stack begins at 4M and grows backward toward lower addresses

In ckb-js-vm, we carefully organize memory regions as follows:

- From address 0 to `_end`: ELF sections
- From address `_end` to 3M: Heap memory for malloc
- From address 3M+4K to 4M: Stack

The 4K serves as a margin area. This organization prevents stack/heap collisions when the stack grows too large.

### Exit Code

When bytecode or JavaScript code throws an uncaught exception, ckb-js-vm will exit with error code (-1).
You can write JavaScript code without explicitly checking for exceptionsâ€”simply let them throw naturally.

QuickJS treats every file as a module. Since it implements [Top level await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await),
the evaluation result of a module is a promise. This means the code below doesn't return -100 as expected:

```js
function main() {
  // ...
  return -100;
}
main();
```

Instead, it unexpectedly returns zero. To ensure your exit code is properly returned, use this pattern instead:

```js
function main() {
  // ...
  return -100;
}
bindings.exit(main());
```

Another tip: always write test cases for failure scenarios. Make sure the error codes returned match what you
expect in these situations.

### Dynamic Loading

JavaScript provides the ability to load modules dynamically at runtime through the `evalJsScript` function in the
`@ckb-js-std/bindings` package. This powerful feature enables extension mechanisms, plugin architectures, and code
splitting in ckb-js-vm. However, it comes with significant security implications. When modules are loaded from
untrusted sources (such as other cells on-chain), they may contain malicious code. A simple `exit(0)` statement
could cause your entire script to exit with a success status, bypassing your validation logic. Bytecode is
particularly problematic as it's extremely difficult to inspect and verify.

If you must use dynamic loading, follow these precautions: only load from trusted sources you control, implement
permission restrictions for loaded code, validate module integrity with cryptographic signatures when possible,
and consider a pattern like this for safer loading:

```js
// Example of safer dynamic loading with basic validation
function loadModule(moduleSource, allowedAPIs) {
  const wrappedSource = `
    (function(restrictedBindings) {
      ${moduleSource}
    })({ ...allowedAPIs });
  `;
  return bindings.evalJsScript(wrappedSource);
}
```

Remember that even with these safeguards, dynamic loading should be used cautiously in security-critical
applications, and avoided entirely when working with untrusted inputs.

### Errors thrown by bindings functions

It is possible that bindings functions throw exceptions that can be handled gracefully. The CKB VM defines
standard error codes that your code should be prepared to handle:

```
CKB_INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUND 1
CKB_ITEM_MISSING 2
```

Common scenarios where these errors occur:

- `CKB_INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUND (1)`: Occurs when iterating beyond available items, such as when looping over cells,
  scripts, witnesses, etc. This error is expected and should be caught to terminate iteration loops.
- `CKB_ITEM_MISSING (2)`: Occurs when a type script is missing. This can be a valid state in some on-chain scrips.

You can handle these exceptions by checking the `errorCode` property of the thrown exception. Here's an example
of properly handling the out-of-bounds case in an iterator:

```typescript
next(): IteratorResult<T> {
  try {
    const item = this.queryFn(this.index, this.source);
    this.index += 1;
    return { value: item, done: false };
  } catch (err: any) {
    if (err.errorCode === bindings.INDEX_OUT_OF_BOUND) {
      // End iteration gracefully when we've reached the end of available items
      return { value: undefined, done: true };
    }
    // Re-throw any other errors with additional context
    throw new Error(`QueryIter error: ${err.message || err}`);
  }
}
```
