# Intro to Script

A <Tooltip>Script</Tooltip> in Nervos CKB is a binary executable that can be executed on-chain. It is Turing-complete and can perform arbitrary logic to guard and protect your on-chain assets. You can think of it as smart contract.

## How a Script Works

When executing a Script, CKB takes the executables and runs them in a virtual machine environment called <Tooltip>CKB-VM</Tooltip>. After the execution, if the program returns a code of 0, we consider the Script successful; any non-zero return codes will be considered Script failures.

When you submit a transaction to CKB, it executes all the Scripts from the transaction to ensure that each Script succeeds. If any Script fails, the transaction will not be included on-chain.

In this way, we can allow the Cell to carry different Scripts to perform various validations for the current transaction, similar to how smart contracts work in other blockchains.

## Script Types

A Script can be one of two types:

- **Lock Script** - Used to control ownership and access to a Cell.
- **Type Script** - Used to control how a Cell is used in a transaction.

In most cases, Lock Script and Type Script function similarly. The only key difference is that, the output Cells' Lock Scripts will NOT be executed in a transaction, whereas the input Cells' Lock Scripts, the input Cells' Type Scripts, and the output Cells' Type Scripts will be executed.

This difference has led to the different usecases of Lock Script and Type Script as we have mentioned above. Lock Script is often used to control owner ship of a Cell while Type Script defines what kinds of changes of a Cell is valid for the transaction.

## Script Structure

Script has the following structure:

```rust
pub struct Script {
    pub code_hash: H256,
    pub hash_type: ScriptHashType,
    pub args: JsonBytes,
}
```

Each Script consists of:

- `code_hash`: Identifies the Script code.
- `hash_type`: Defines how to interpret `code_hash` when locating the Script code.
- `args`: Parameters passed to the Script, used to customize behavior.

The combination of `code_hash` and `hash_type` tells CKB how to locate the Script code:

- `data`, `data1`, `data2`(data hash): Match the hash of the Script binary directly.
- `type`(type hash): Matches the hash of a Cellâ€™s Type Script.

For a deeper comparison, see [Data Hash vs. Type Hash](/docs/tech-explanation/data-type-diff).

A Script also includes the `args` part, which differentiates one Script from another using the same Script code. The `args` can provide additional arguments for a CKB Script. For example, while multiple users might utilize the same default Lock Script code, each user can have their own public key hash stored in `args`. This setup allows each user to have a unique Lock Script while sharing the same Lock Script code.
