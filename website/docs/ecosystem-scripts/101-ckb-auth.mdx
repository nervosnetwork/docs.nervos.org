# CKB Auth

A consolidated library featuring numerous blockchains authentication techniques
on CKB-VM.
We also write a repository to demonstrate how to use this library:
[ckb-auth-example](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth-examples).

CKB Auth uses `Exec` or `Dynamic Library` at the low level to support cross-module calls. The high-level interface currently supports C and Rust (other languages can also interact via CKB Syscalls, but the implementation is more complex).

The following blockchains are supported:

- [Bitcoin](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth/blob/main/docs/bitcoin.md)
- [Ethereum](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth/blob/main/docs/ethereum.md)
- [EOS](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth/blob/main/docs/eos.md)
- [Tron](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth/blob/main/docs/tron.md)
- [Dogecoin](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth/blob/main/docs/dogecoin.md)
- CKB
- [Litecoin](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth/blob/main/docs/litecoin.md)
- [Cardano](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth/blob/main/docs/cardano.md)
- [Monero](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth/blob/main/docs/monero.md)
- [Solana](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth/blob/main/docs/solana.md)
- [Ripple](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth/blob/main/docs/XRP.md)

## How It Works

Signature verification requires the following four parameters:

- **Algorithm ID**: Identifies the signature algorithm, 1 byte.
- **Public key hash**: Can be a hash (e.g., blake160) of a public key, a preimage, or other data. `blake160` refers to the first 20 bytes of a `blake2b` hash.
- **Signature data**: Variable-length signature data.
- **Message**: The message to be verified.

These parameters must be provided to CKB Auth by the developer. Typically, `Algorithm ID` and `Public key hash` are combined into 21 bytes and stored in `Args`; `Signature data` is passed through the `witness`; and the `Message` is generated by hashing `tx_hash` together with `Witnesses` (resulting in 32 bytes). See: [`generate_sighash_all`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-auth-examples/blob/main/C/auth_c_example.c#L70C5-L70C25).
