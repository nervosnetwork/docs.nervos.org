## Grammar

- [EBNF Version](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule/blob/master/docs/grammar/grammar.ebnf)

## Language Reference

### Comments

```c
// This is a line comment
```

Block comments:

```c
/* This
   is
   a
   block
   comment
 */
```

### Built-in Types

#### Primitive Type

There is only one built-in primitive type: `byte`.

:::note

Molecule serialization does not consider the order of user data where a sequence of bytes is stored in memory. You must pack and unpack the data manually.

:::

#### Composite Types

- `array`
  An array consists of an item type and an unsigned integer.

```c
array ArrayName [ItemType; N];  // N is an unsigned integer
```

- `struct`
  A struct consists of a set of named and typed fields.

```c
struct StructName {
    field_name_1: FieldType1,
    field_name_2: FieldType2,
    field_name_3: FieldType3,
}
```

- `vector`
  A vector contains only one item type.

```c
vector VectorName <ItemType>;
```

- `table`
  A table consists of a set of named and typed fields, same as `struct`.

```c
table TableName {
    field_name_1: FieldType1,
    field_name_2: FieldType2,
    field_name_3: FieldType3,
}
```

- `option`
  An option contains only an item type.

```c
option OptionName (ItemType);
```

- `union`
  A `union` contains a set of item types.

```c
union UnionName {
    ItemType1,
    ItemType2,
    ItemType3,
}
```

### Keywords

- `import`
  Import types from other schema files.

```c
import ../library/common_types;
```
