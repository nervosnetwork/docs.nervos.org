# Quick Start (5min)

We recommend using [offCKB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@offckb/cli) to quickly set up a local development environment using our pre-built boilerplates. This streamlined approach allows you to jumpstart your project efficiently without the hassle of manual configuration.

## Install OffCKB

OffCKB provides a one-line command to start a local blockchain (CKB Devnet) with pre-funded test accounts and built-in <Tooltip>Scripts</Tooltip> like [Omnilock](https://github.com/cryptape/omnilock) and [Spore-contract](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-contract).

```bash
npm install -g @offckb/cli
```

:::info
Throughout this documentation, we use offckb/cli version **>=0.3.0**. You can always run the above command to update to the latest version.

## Create a New Project

To setup a boilerplate for a full-stacked dApp, run the following command. Replace `<my-dapp-project>` with any name you like.

```bash
offckb create <my-dapp-project>
```

When prompted to select a bare template, use your arrow keys to selectÂ the frontend framework you prefer. If you wish to use a frontend framework not listed, please refer to [this section](/docs/getting-started/quick-start#different-frontend-framework).

<details>
  <summary>How to create a Script-only project?</summary>

To create a project focused solely on Script development without any frontend work, you can run the following command. Replace `<my-script-project>` with any name you like.

```bash
offckb create --script <my-script-project>
```

Note that `offckb` essentially utilizes an underlying tool called `ckb-script-templates` to initialize Script projects. You can directly engage `ckb-script-templates` for more specific Script development tasks. For further details, refer to the [Script tutorial](/docs/script/minimal-script).

Your local CKB blockchain is currently active with the RPC endpoint at [localhost:8114](http://localhost:8114). To stop the chain, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal. To resume where you left off, simply run `offckb node` again.

If you need to start fresh with a new chain, run the following command before starting the node:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="clean-node-data" label="Command">
```

```bash
offckb clean
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node-data-cleaned" label="Response">
```

```bash
Chain data cleaned.
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Run the DApp Project

The dApp is based on various JavaScript web frontend frameworks, such as `Remix-Vite` and `Next.js`, and is integrated with the CKB JavaScript framework, [Lumos](https://github.com/ckb-js/lumos). All Lumos-related code is defined in the `frontend/offckb.config.ts` file.

To start development, navigate to the frontend workspace:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Now, run the following command to install dependencies and start the dApp:

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

Once the server is up and running, you can view the dApp by visiting [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. As you make changes to the file, the page will automatically update to reflect your edits. For detailed instructions on how to start the dApp and explore additional config options, please see the `README.md` file.

## DApp Project Structure

The boilerplate project for a full-stack CKB dApp comprises two main components:

- The frontend, which utilizes the CKB JavaScript framework, [CCC](https://github.com/ckb-devrel/ccc).
- The Scripts, which leverage the [ckb-script-templates](https://github.com/cryptape/ckb-script-templates).

By default, the Next.js template comes with a simple Script `hello-world` under `contracts/hello-world/src/main.rs`.

<ScriptTools />

### Script-Related Commands

- Add a new Script: `make generate`
- Build Script: `make build`
- Run unit tests: `make test`

### Deploy Scripts to Blockchain

After building your Scripts, you can navigate to your frontend workspace and deploy your Scripts to the Devnet or Testnet by using the following command:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="deploy-to-devnet" label="Devnet">
```

```sh
offckb deploy --network devnet
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="deploy-to-testnet" label="Testnet">
```

```sh
offckb deploy --network testnet
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Use Scripts in Frontend

If the deployment is successful, the `offckb.config.ts` file will contain the necessary details to import and utilize your Scripts in your frontend dApp. Here's how you can use your Scripts directly:

```ts
import offckb from "offckb.config";

const myScriptDeps: CellDep[] = offCKB.myScripts["YOUR_SCRIPT_NAME"]!.cellDeps;
const myScript: Script = {
  codeHash: offCKB.myScripts["hash-lock"]!.codeHash,
  hashType: offCKB.myScripts["hash-lock"]!.hashType,
  args: lockArgs,
};
```

## Use a Different Frontend Framework? {#different-frontend-framework}

The frontend world is filled with numerous (perhaps too many) frameworks. New frameworks come out every day, and different developers have different preferences among these frameworks. So if you don't use the framework in the pre-defined boilerplate, like `remix-vite` and `next.js`, don't worry! You can still use `offckb` with the `inject-config` command.

First, simply initialize your dApp project with your preferred framework, such as [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/):

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="create-my-cra-dapp" label="Command">
```

```bash
npx create-react-app my-cra-dapp --template typescript
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="my-cra-dapp-created" label="Response">
```

```bash
Creating a new React app in /Users/nervosDocs/Desktop/offckb/my-cra-dapp.

Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.
Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts with cra-template-typescript...
added 1489 packages in 2m

```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

Next, navigate to your dApp directory and initialize the `offckb` config within your framework:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="inject-config" label="Command">
```

```bash
cd my-cra-dapp
offckb inject-config
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="config-injected" label="Response">
```

```bash
All good. You can now use it in your project like:

  import offCKB from "offckb.config";

  const myScriptCodeHash = offCKB.myScripts['script-name'].codeHash;
  const omnilockScriptCodeHash = offCKB.systemScripts['omnilock'].codeHash;

Check example at https://github.com/nervosnetwork/docs.nervos.org/tree/develop/examples/simple-transfer
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

Now, when you deploy your Scripts with `offckb deploy --network devnet --target <your-folder-to-your-script-binaries>`, run the following command in your frontend root path where the `offckb.config.ts` file is located to update the deployed Scripts info for your frontend.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sync-config" label="Command">
```

```bash
offckb sync-scripts
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="config-synced" label="Response">
```

```bash
scripts json config updated.
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

For switching between different networks, you might need to update the `readEnvNetwork` method in `offckb.config.ts` according to your framework.

```ts
function readEnvNetwork(): "devnet" | "testnet" | "mainnet" {
  // you may need to update the env method
  // according to your frontend framework
  const network = process.env.NETWORK;
  const defaultNetwork = "devnet";
  if (!network) return defaultNetwork;
  if (!["devnet", "testnet", "mainnet"].includes(network)) {
    return defaultNetwork;
  }

  return network as "devnet" | "testnet" | "mainnet";
}
```

## Debug a transaction

If you are using the offckb dApp template to create your project, one of the beneficial is that all the failed transactions will be dumped and recorded so you can debug them later.

Everytime you run a transaction, you can debug it with the transaction hash:

```sh
offckb debug <transaction-hash>
```

It will verify all the scripts in the transaction and print the detailed info in the terminal.

```sh
offckb debug --tx-hash 0x64c936ee78107450d49e57b7453dce9031ce68b056b2f1cdad5c2218ab7232ad

If you want to debug a single cell script in the transaction, you can use the following command:

```sh
offckb debug <transaction-hash> --single-script <single-cell-script-option>
```

The `single-cell-script-option` format is `<cell-type>[<cell-index>].<script-type>`, eg: `"input[0].lock"`

- `cell-type` could be `input` or `output`, refers to the cell type
- `cell-index` is the index of the cell in the transaction
- `script-type` could be `lock` or `type`, refers to the script type

Or you can replace the script with a binary file in your single cell script debug session:

```sh
offckb debug <transaction-hash> --single-script <single-cell-script-option> --bin <path/to/binary/file>
```

All the debug utils are borrowed from [ckb-debugger](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-standalone-debugger/tree/develop/ckb-debugger).

## About offckb.config.ts

`offckb.config.ts` is a straightforward TypeScript file that encapsulates basic devnet information. Everything is explicitly defined, making it easy to modify. This minimalistic approach ensures that `offckb` does not impose limitations on the tech selections and development processes of developers.
