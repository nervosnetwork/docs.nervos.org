# Quick Start (5min)

We recommend using [offCKB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@offckb/cli) to quickly set up a local development environment using our pre-built boilerplates. This streamlined approach allows you to jumpstart your project efficiently without the hassle of manual configuration.

## Install OffCKB

OffCKB provides a one-line command to start a local blockchain (CKB Devnet) with pre-funded test accounts and built-in <Tooltip>Scripts</Tooltip> like [Omnilock](https://github.com/cryptape/omnilock) and [Spore-contract](https://github.com/sporeprotocol/spore-contract).

```bash
npm install -g @offckb/cli
```

:::info
Throughout this documentation, we use offckb/cli version **>=0.4.0**. You can always run the above command to update to the latest version.
:::

## Start the Devnet

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="start-devnet" label="Command">
```

```bash
offckb node
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="show-start-devnet" label="Response">
```

```bash
Launching CKB devnet Node...
CKB devnet RPC Proxy server running on http://127.0.0.1:28114
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

Your local CKB blockchain is currently active with a proxy RPC endpoint at [localhost:28114](http://localhost:28114). To stop the chain, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal. To resume where you left off, simply run `offckb node` again.

If you need to start fresh with a new chain, run the following command before starting the node:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="clean-node-data" label="Command">
```

```bash
offckb clean
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node-data-cleaned" label="Response">
```

```bash
Chain data cleaned.
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Create a CKB Smart Contract Project

You can create a new CKB Smart Contract project in Typescript from our boilerplate.

```sh
offckb create <your-project-name> -c <your-contract-name>
```

The `-c` option is optional, if you don't provide it, the contract name will be `hello-world`.

After create the project, you can follow the instructions on build, deploy and test the contract in README.md of the project.

The project includes both `mock` test and `devnet` test. For developing frontend interacting with the blockchain, you can refer to the `devnet` test and see how it works.

### Deploy a CKB Smart Contract

To deploy the script, use `offckb deploy` command:

```sh
offckb deploy --network <devnet/testnet> --target <path-to-your-contract-binary-file-or-folder> --output <output-folder-path>
```

Pass `--type-id` option if you want Scripts to be upgradable

```sh
offckb deploy --type-id --network <devnet/testnet>
```

Your deployed scripts info will be be listed in the `output-folder-path` which you defined in the command.

Note that upgrades are keyed by the contractâ€˜s artifact name. If you plan to upgrade with `--type-id`, do not rename your contract artifact (e.g. keep `hello-world.bc`). Renaming it makes the offckb unable to find the previous Type ID info from the `output-folder-path` and will create a new Type ID.

### Debug a transaction

If you are interacting the CKB devnet via the proxy RPC server(`localhost:28114`), all the failed transactions will be dumped and recorded so you can debug them later.

Every time you run a transaction, you can debug it with the transaction hash:

```sh
offckb debug <transaction-hash>
```

It will verify all the scripts in the transaction and print the detailed info in the terminal.

```sh
offckb debug --tx-hash 0x64c936ee78107450d49e57b7453dce9031ce68b056b2f1cdad5c2218ab7232ad
Dump transaction successfully

If you want to debug a single cell script in the transaction, you can use the following command:

```sh
offckb debug <transaction-hash> --single-script <single-cell-script-option>
```

The `single-cell-script-option` format is `<cell-type>[<cell-index>].<script-type>`, eg: `"input[0].lock"`

- `cell-type` could be `input` or `output`, refers to the cell type
- `cell-index` is the index of the cell in the transaction
- `script-type` could be `lock` or `type`, refers to the script type

Or you can replace the script with a binary file in your single cell script debug session:

```sh
offckb debug <transaction-hash> --single-script <single-cell-script-option> --bin <path/to/binary/file>
```

All the debug utils are borrowed from [ckb-debugger](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-standalone-debugger/tree/develop/ckb-debugger).
