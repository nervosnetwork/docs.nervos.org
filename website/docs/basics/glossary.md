### Block Interval
Also known as [Block Time](#block-time). Block interval is the length of time it takes to create a new block in a cryptocurrency blockchain. Block interval is the measure of the time it takes the miners or validators within a network to verify transactions within one block and produce a new block in that blockchain. The block interval is variable on Nervos blockchain.

The block interval on the Bitcoin blockchain is approximately every 10 minutes. The block interval on Nervos is variable, but is usually under 10 seconds.

#### Synonyms

## Economics Glossary

### Base Issuance
Base issuance is the basic CKByte issuance with a fixed and decreasing schedule. Base issuance is awarded to miners as incentives to protect the network and also as an indirect token distribution method.

Base issuance is limited to a finite total supply 33.6G (33.6 billion) CKBytes.

---

### Base Reward
Base reward is the block reward (in CKBytes) to miners generated from the base issuance. Base reward halves approximately every 4 years until eventually reaching 0, like Bitcoin.

#### See Also
- [Base Issuance](#base-issuance)
- [CKByte](#ckbyte)
- [Miner](#miner)
- [Transaction](#transaction)

---

### Commit Reward
A reward paid to miners in CKBytes for committing a previously proposed transaction. After the transaction has been committed it is confirmed.

#### See Also
- [CKByte](#ckbyte)
- [Confirmation](#confirmation)
- [Miner](#miner)
- [Transaction](#transaction)

---

### Economic Abstraction
With proper tool support, users can use tokens other than CKByte (for example, stable coins) to pay transactions fees, a concept known as "Economic Abstraction".

---

### Fiat Currency
Fiat currencies are a medium of exchange established as money, often by government regulation. Fiat money does not have intrinsic value and does not have use value. It has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value.

#### See Also
- [Cryptocurrency](#cryptocurrency)
- [Digital Currency](#digital-currency)

---

### Heavy Asset Problem
A common problem found in multi-asset blockchain platforms where the value of the assets stored on the chain gains significant value but the native token of the chain does not. This raises the incentive to attack the the network, but does not increase the security because the value of the native token is what is used to secure the network.

---

### Starving Layer 1 Problem
A scenario that can arise in multi-layer blockchain platforms where the vast majority of the transaction traffic moves from layer 1 to layer 2, taking the vast majority of transaction fees with it. If layer 1 relies exclusively on transaction fees to support the security of the platform, it may end up not having enough incentives available to properly secure it.

---

### Tail Emission
A type of reward that is paid to miners through a fixed amount of inflation.

#### See Also

#### See Also
- [Tragedy of the Security Commons](#tragedy-of-the-security-commons)
- [Tragedy of the Storage Commons](#tragedy-of-the-storage-commons)

---

### Tragedy of the Security Commons
A situation that can emerge on multi-asset blockchain platforms where asset tokens rely on the storage and security of the blockchain platform, but do not contribute back to the platform. As the number of assets that "ride for free" increases, so does the burden placed on the underlying blockchain platform. If the assets do not contribute to the underlying platform, the available security may not properly support the network.

#### See Also
- [Heavy Asset Problem](#heavy-asset-problem)
- [Tragedy of the Commons](#tragedy-of-the-commons)
- [Tragedy of the Storage Commons](#tragedy-of-the-storage-commons)

---

### Tragedy of the Storage Commons
A situation that can emerge on incentivized blockchain platforms where mining rewards are paid for inclusion of data to the blockchain, but no rewards exist for the long-term persistance of the blockchain data. As the size of the chain grows, so do the costs associated with persisting the data. If there is no direct incentive for persisting data, fewer and fewer nodes will do so. Eventually, too few nodes will be available to properly support the network.

### `initial_primary_epoch_reward`

Incentives paid to miners in CKBytes by epoch in CKB base issuance. Under CKB's consensus, block interval is uncertain, while epoch can be fixed at approximately 4 hours, so reward issuance is determined by epoch. Each epoch issues 1_917_808_21917808 Shannons of CKBytes, whose total amount is fixed but halves every 4 years. 

The initial base issuance is 4.2 billion CKBytes per year. Similar to Bitcoin, the base issuance halves approximately every 4 years until it stops.

To calculate, [block reward](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/glossary/#block-reward) = `initial_primary_epoch_reward` / epoch_length (the number of blocks in the epoch).

```
pub(crate) const INITIAL_PRIMARY_EPOCH_REWARD: Capacity = Capacity::shannons(1_917_808_21917808);

### Transaction Confirmation Number
The number of confirmations required for a transaction to be added to a block. 

As permissionless blockchain designs offer only probabilistic finality, a transaction can never be fully confirmed, facing an adversary with infinite computational power. Therefore, users and apps can choose a number they deem secure. We briefly discuss one factor here that influences the level of security: the recent orphan rate. It takes 6 confirmations to fully settle a transaction when the orphan rate is 0, and 24 confirmations when the rate reaches 2.5% to achieve the same level of security (See the rationale and calculation [here](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/essays/tx-confirmation/)).

In blockchain settlement assurance, transaction confirmation is one of the variables that cannot be easily quantified (See Nic Carter’s [article](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/its-the-settlement-assurances-stupid-5dcd1c3f4e41)). The exact number is open to adjustment depending on the security level that users desire. Nervos CKB sets a minimum of 15 confirmations, which should be considered conservative.

### Transaction Hash

Transaction hash, or Txhash, is the unique identifier of a transaction in a blockchain that acts as a record or proof that the transaction has taken place. To get a transaction hash in CKB, the transaction is serialized via Molecule, then the serialized raw is feed to ckbhash function. Its schema is:

```
table Transaction {
    raw:            RawTransaction,
    witnesses:      BytesVec,
}
```

Transaction hash is generated by the serialized `raw` structure through [ckbhash](#ckbhash).

#### See Also
- [Transaction Witness Hash](#transaction-witness-hash)
- [Molecule](#molecule)
- [Ckbhash](#ckbhash)
- [Transaction Hash in RFC on Nervos Network Github](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0027-block-structure/0027-block-structure.md#transaction-hash)

---

### Transaction Witness Hash

Transaction witness hash is generated by the serialized transaction through ckbhash. Transaction is serialized via [molecule](#molecule) in CKB. Its schema is:

```

    witnesses:      BytesVec,
}
```

---

### `type_id`

One of the CKB `system_scripts`. A unique feature of Type ID is that it‘s a CKB built-in script directly implemented in Rust. It doesn't run in CKB-VM but can be used in the same way as other [CKB genesis scripts](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0024-ckb-genesis-script-list/0024-ckb-genesis-script-list.md#type-id).

For a deeper understanding of Type ID, check out this blog post: [Introduction to CKB Script Programming 6: Type ID](https://xuejie.space/2020_02_03_introduction_to_ckb_script_programming_type_id/) (also translated into [Chinese](https://talk.nervos.org/t/ckb-type-id/4258)).

### Type Script Hash

Or `type_hash`, a Blake2b hash of a Type Script which is used as an identifier for the Script when referenced by a Cell.

The two entities in the data structure of CKB’s cell are `lock` and `type`. Type scripts can capture any validation logic needed in the cell transformation.

Type scripts can implement economic constructs as well. NervosDAO is completely implemented as a type script with minimal support from the consensus layer.

---

### Uncle
Or Uncle Block. Uncle blocks are created when two blocks are mined and submitted to the ledger at roughly the same time. Only one can enter the ledger as an included block, and the other does not.

Uncles are paid a reduced block reward when they are found and reported.

On Nervos, Uncles are tracked by consensus to adjust the block interval of the network.

An uncle block has to meet the following conditions:

- An uncle should not be on the main chain; in other words, it should not be an uncle if it includes any block from the main chain.
- Uncle’s block number must be smaller than the block‘s number that later includes it.
- Uncle‘s parent must be on the main chain, or uncle’s parent must also be an uncle. In other words, uncle must be linkable to the main chain in any way. It can never be a random block that is not on the main chain.

```
- if !snapshot.is_main_chain(&uncle.hash()) // It should not be on the main chain.
- && !snapshot.is_uncle(&uncle.hash()) // It should not be an uncle twice. 
- && uncle.number() < candidate_number // The block number of the uncle should be smaller than that of any block on the main chain. 
- && (uncles.iter().any(|u| u.hash() == parent_hash) 
|| snapshot.is_main_chain(&parent_hash) // Uncle block should not be parentless. The parent of un uncle must be a block on the main chain or another uncle. 
|| snapshot.is_uncle(&parent_hash))
```

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/uncle_rule.png")}/>

As illustrated above, A is the main chain. B3 can be the uncle of A4 (to be included in A4), since B3 is linked to A2. However, B4 cannot be included in A4, since the uncle’s block number must be smaller than A4, the current block on the main chain.

Similarly, B4 can be the uncle of A5 (be included by A5). Although B4‘s parent, B3, is not on the main chain, B3 is the uncle of A4. For this reason, B4 is a legal uncle, and B3 cannot be included by A5.

C2 and C3 cannot be linked to the main chain as their parent is unknown, therefore, they cannot be uncles.
