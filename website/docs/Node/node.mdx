# Run Node

Running a CKB node boosts network robustness and decentralization while enhancing data access security. 

Select the CKB Node that suits your needs and circumstances:

- **Mainnet Node**: Optimal for active involvement in the live network. We suggest a minimum of 100GB of local storage for this purpose.
- **Testnet Node**: Ideal for exploring functionalities in a risk-free environment.  We suggest allocating 200GB for experimenting.
- **Devnet Node**: Ideal for local dev environment to start building your CKB dApp. No special local storage required.
- **RPC Node**: Set up a Nervos API endpoint for your project without running any CKB nodes yourself.
