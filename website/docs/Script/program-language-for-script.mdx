# Program Languages For Script

We have learned that what is Script and how does Script works. So how do we write a script then? What kinds of program language do I need to write it?

Well, different from other blockchains, the CKB-VM is more like a real mini computer based on [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/), so the CKB script code also looks like a normal Unix style executable program we run on a computer. 

You can acutlly write scripts in any program language you want as long as you have the proper toolchain. 

But in the current stage, we recommand you to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to write CKB script since it has complete toolchain to work with CKB. 

We also use `Rust` as the program language across the tutorials in this website.

## Rust

Rust can easily compile the source code to riscv target so that the code can be executed on CKB-VM. 

We have also build some useful Rust libaries and template tool to help developers to build Script:

- ckb-std: [https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-std](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-std)
- ckb_testtools: [https://docs.rs/ckb-testtool/latest/ckb_testtool](https://docs.rs/ckb-testtool/latest/ckb_testtool)
- cargo-generate script templates: [ckb-script-templates](https://github.com/cryptape/ckb-script-templates)

## C

You can also use [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) language and [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) to write and compile the CKB Script to riscv binary. 

Some of our guys have use this way to build Scripts like [sUDT](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0025-simple-udt/0025-simple-udt.md) and [xUDT](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/pull/428). You can check [ckb-production-scripts](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-production-scripts/tree/master/c) for reference.

## Javascript, golang, ruby, lua, python...too?

Since the CKB-VM is more like a real mini computer, there is no reason you can't run differernt program language codes in this mini computer, right? 

The answer is yes, you can run code written in any program language in CKB. The way how it works is that you deploy a language-sepecific dependecy as a Script on CKB first, and then run your code on top of this Script, and Boom, it just works!

Take javascript for example, all we need to do is just take a JavaScript implementation for the embeded system, eg [duktape](https://github.com/svaarala/duktape), compile it from C to RISC-V binary, put it on chain, then boom, we can run JavaScript in CKB! Since we are working with a real mini computer here, there’s no stopping us from embeding another VM as CKB script to CKB VM, and exploring this VM on top of VM path.

Expand from this path, we can also have Ruby on CKB via [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby), we can even have Bitcoin Script or EVM on chain if we just compile their VM and put it on chain.

If you would like explore such path, you can check the following two examples:

- [duktape on CKB](https://xuejie.space/2019_07_13_introduction_to_ckb_script_programming_script_basics)
- [Godwoken-Polyjuice](https://github.com/godwokenrises/godwoken/tree/develop/gwos-evm): implementation of EVM on CKB

### Yes I know this is possible, but won’t VM on top of VM be slow?

The answer is that it really depends on your use case to say if this is gonna be slow. Benchmarks make no sense unless we put it in a real use case with standard hardware requirements. So wait to see if this is really gonna be an issue. 

Besides, we are also working on this field to optimize both CKB VM and the VMs on top of CKB VM to make it faster and faster :P

## But I still want to use a Script-dedicated language?

If you come from Ethereum community, you might have used to use a dedicated program language to write smart contracts, like [solidity](https://soliditylang.org/). 

You might ask the same thing for CKB Script. There indeed is a CKB Script dedicated program language build by CKB community called [Cell-Script](https://github.com/cell-labs/cell-script). Right now it is still in the early stage, but feel free to try it and give feedback to the community.
