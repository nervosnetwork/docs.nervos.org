title: Script & Code: The Difference
---

We differentiate the terms Script and Code as below:

- Script is a data structure referencing to runnable on-chain code.
- Code refers to the RISC-V binary, runnable in CKB-VM and can be referenced to by the Script structure.
- A code Cell is a Cell containing RISC-V binary code.
- Script does not directly include code; it simply stores a pointer to reference code.
