# Type Script {#type-script}

This determines the type of the Cell, typically defining the conditions for Cell transformation, or state transition constraints. It specifies how the `data` of new Cells is transformed from old ones. `type` must have a data structure as `Script`.

In a transaction, when input Cell and output Cell share the same Type Script, the transformation between them must follow the rules defined by that Type Script.

A typical use case of Type Script is in <Tooltip>UDT</Tooltip>. In token issuance, new tokens will be created as new Cell outputs, so a Type Script is required to validate that these new tokens are created adhere to predefined rules.

:::note
Type Script is optional.
