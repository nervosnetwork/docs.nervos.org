# Cell_deps

`Cell_deps` allows Scripts in the transaction to access referenced Live Cells.Â Cells listed here are all live and read-only.

`Cell_deps` includes a `dep_type` field to differentiate the normal Cells, which directly provide the code, and the `dep_groups` expanded to its members inside `cell_deps`.
