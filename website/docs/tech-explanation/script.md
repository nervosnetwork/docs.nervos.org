# Script

## Structure

In addition to the rules defined by the CKB protocol, verification based on the Scripts in the input and output Cells of the transaction is also required.

```bash
Script: {
  code_hash: HexString
  args: HexString
  hash_type: Uint8, there are 4 allowed values: {0: "data", 1: "type", 2: "data1", 4: "data2"}
}
```

## Script vs. Code

We differentiate the terms Script and Code as follows:

- Script is a data structure referencing to runnable on-chain code.
- Code refers to the RISC-V binary, runnable in CKB-VM and can be referenced to by the Script structure.
- A code Cell is a Cell containing RISC-V binary code.
- Script does not directly include code; it simply stores a pointer to reference the code.
