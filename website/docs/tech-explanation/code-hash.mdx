id: code-hash
title: code_hash
---

This represents the hash of the ELF formatted RISC-V binary that contains a CKB Script. For efficiency, the script itself is stored in a dep cell attached to the current transaction. Depending on the hash_type value, the code_hash specified here should either match the hash of the Cell data, or that of the type script in the dep cell. During transaction verification, the actual binary is loaded into a CKB-VM instance when specified.
