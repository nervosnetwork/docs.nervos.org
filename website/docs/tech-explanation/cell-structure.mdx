A Cell is the smallest and fundamental unit in Nervos CKB, used for storing states.

In a transaction, some Cells from previous transactions are destroyed, and new cells are created. Cells destroyed and created are inputs and outputs.

```
Cell: {
  capacity: HexString; 
  lock: Script;
  type: Script; 
  data: HexString; 
}
```
