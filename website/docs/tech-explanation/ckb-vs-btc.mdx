title: CKB vs. BTC
---

CKB draws inspiration from Bitcoin, the pioneer of blockchain, and builds on Bitcoin’s foundational innovations such as UTXO and Proof of Work, while uniquely focusing on enhancing contract flexibility and layer 2 solutions tailored for Bitcoin. This guide will walk you through key concepts and comparisons to get you started on your journey with Nervos CKB, focusing on the [basic unit](#utxo-vs-cell), [virtual machine (VM)](#bitcoin-script-interpreter-vs-ckb-vm), [Scripts](#btc-script-vs-ckb-script), [transaction structure](#btc-transaction-vs-ckb-transaction), and [verification process](#unlocking--verification-process).

## UTXO vs Cell

### BTC’s UTXO

A UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) is the remaining amount of digital currency after a transaction is completed. For instance, if Alice has 5 BTC and sends 4 BTC to Bob, two new UTXOs are created: one for Bob (4 BTC) and one for Alice (0.999 BTC). Note that the total value of the UTXOs is less than the input amount because the difference is paid as a transaction fee to miners.

  alt="UTXO example"
/>

UTXOs contain a single lock, known as a `scriptPubKey`, which sets the conditions that must be met for the UTXO to be spent.

Here’s the data structure of a UTXO:

```json
{
  "value": 5, // The amount of Bitcoin
  "scriptPubKey": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <PubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG" // The locking Script that sets the conditions for spending the UTXO
}
```

/>

### CKB’s Cell

Unlike UTXOs, Cells offer more flexibility. A Cell is the basic unit in CKB and can store not only cryptocurrency but also other types of data, like images, videos, and codes. Cells include both a Lock Script and a Type Script:

- **Lock Script:** Works like the `scriptPubKey` in Bitcoin, defining the conditions under which the Cell can be unlocked and spent.
- **Type Script:** An optional Script that defines the conditions for Cell transformation, or state transition.

Here’s the data structure of a Cell:

```json
{
  "capacity": "0x19995d0ccf", // The size of the Cell (in shannons)
  "lock": {
    // A Script that defines the ownership of the Cell
    "code_hash": "0x9bd7e06f3ecf4be0f2fcd2188b23f1b9fcc88e5d4b65a8637b17723bbda3cce8",
    "args": "0x0a486fb8f6fe60f76f001d6372da41be91172259",
    "hash_type": "type"
  },
  "type": null // An optional Script that defines the type of the Cell.
}
```

## Bitcoin Script Interpreter vs. CKB-VM

### Bitcoin Script Interpreter

The Bitcoin Script Interpreter is **stack-based**, meaning it uses a stack data structure to store temporary data during Script execution. Operations in Bitcoin Script push (add) and pop (remove) data from the stack. Here's a GIF depicting a typical Bitcoin Script operation like simple P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash):

### **CKB-VM**

CKB-VM uses the RISC-V instruction set, which is a modern, open-source architecture. This design provides a low-level access to the CPU, enabling highly efficient execution and flexibility. Any programming language that can target RISC-V can be used natively for development on CKB. Here's a GIF depicting a typical CKB-VM process, where the Script validates a transaction by loading values from the transaction data and returning `0` for a valid transaction or `1` for an invalid one.

## BTC transaction vs CKB transaction

### Transaction Lifecycle

In blockchain systems, the transaction lifecycle spans several stages, from creation to confirmation.

<img
  src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/transaction-lifecycle.png"
  width="688px"
  height="132px"
  alt="Transaction lifecycle spans from creation to confirmation"
/>

1. **Create**: The transaction is constructed by specifying the digital assets to be transferred, along with any necessary inputs and outputs.
2. **Sign**: The transaction is authenticated by the sender using their private key to validate ownership or permission to transfer the assets.
3. **Broadcast**: The transaction is broadcasted from sender’s wallet to the nearest network node.
4. **Validate**: The node validates the transaction by verifying its integrity, the authenticity of its signature, compliance with blockchain protocols, and customized rules.
5. **Propagate**: Once validated, the node propagates the transaction to other nodes in the network. The transaction enters the mempool, a temporary storage area for transactions waiting to be included in a block.
6. **Confirm**: When the block containing the transaction is mined and added to the blockchain, the transaction is considered confirmed. Each subsequent block that references this block increases the number of confirmations, securing the transaction.

### BTC Transaction

Bitcoin transactions are built on the UTXO model, where each transaction output can be used as an input for future transactions.

    }
  ],
  "locktime": "00000000" // The earliest time that the transaction can be added to the blockchain
}
```

- The `txid` and `vout` in the `inputs` field specify which UTXOs are being used as inputs from previous transactions on the blockchain.
- The `scriptsig` in each input field contains the digital signature and public key needed to unlock the UTXOs.
- The transaction creates new `outputs`, each with a specific `amount` indicating the value being transferred.
- A `scriptPubKey` is applied to each output, specifying the conditions required to spend these outputs in future transactions. Typically, this includes the recipient’s public key hash and opcodes to verify a signature.

### CKB Transaction

While the UTXO model is straightforward and efficient for cryptocurrency transactions, the Cell Model in Nervos CKB provides greater versatility, making it suitable for a wider range of applications. The Cell Model centers around state as the fundamental element. In CKB, a transaction updates the state by destroying Live Cells and creating new ones, where the total capacity of the destroyed Cells must be greater than or equal to the newly-created Cells, preventing the creation of additional capacity.

## Unlocking & Verification Process

### BTC Example

In this example, we explore how Alice can spend a UTXO that is secured by a custom locking Script. This Script demands that two provided numbers sum to exactly 8 to validate the transaction.

The locking Script, stored in the `ScriptPubKey` of the UTXO, specifies the conditions under which the token can be spent. It is defined as follows:

```json
OP_ADD <8> OP_EQUAL
```

<img
  src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/btc-locking-script.png"
  width="688px"
  height="128px"
  alt="The locking script in a UTXO"
/>

To unlock the UTXO for spending, Alice must provide an unlocking Script that meets the conditions of the locking Script. In this case, Alice provides:

```json
OP_3 OP_5
```

<img
  src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/btc-unlocking-script.png"
  width="688px"
  height="176px"
  alt="The unlocking Script in a transaction's input"
/>

The following are the step-by-step breakdown of the verification process:

1. Execution of the unlocking Script in the `scriptSig`

- `OP_3` pushes the number 3 onto the stack
- `OP_5` pushes the number 5 onto the stack
  <img
    src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/execute-locking-script.png"
    width="688px"
    height="345px"
    alt="Execution of locking script"
  />

2. Execution of the locking Script in the `scriptPubKey` associated with the UTXO:

- `OP_ADD` pops the top two numbers from the stack (5 and 3), adds them together, and pushes the result (8) back onto the stack
  <img
    src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/execute-op-add.png"
    width="688px"
    height="424px"
    alt="Execution of OP_ADD"
  />

3. `<8>` pushes the number 8 onto the stack
   <img
     src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/execute-8.png"
     width="688px"
     height="345px"
     alt="Push the number 8 onto the stack"
   />
4. `OP_EQUAL` pops the top two numbers from the stack (8 and 8), checks if they are equal, and pushes the result (TRUE) back onto the stack.
   <img
     src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/execute-op-equal.png"
     width="688px"
     height="424px"
     alt="Execution of OP_EQUAL"
   />
5. If the final value left on the stack is `TRUE`, the transaction is considered **valid**. If the stack ends with `False` or is empty, the transaction is **invalid**.

### CKB Example

In the CKB example, the Scripting logic is implemented in a more versatile programming environment compared to Bitcoin’s stack-based Script system. Here we’ll use the same example that we used for BTC where Alice wants to spend a Live Cell that is locked by a Script requiring two numbers that, when provided, must sum to 8.

We’ll use pseudocode to represent the Lock Script:

```rust
const v1 = load_value1_from_witness();
const v2 = load_value2_from_witness();

const result = v1 + v2;

if (result === 8) { return 0; }
return 1;
```

<img
  src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/ckb-lock-script.png"
  width="688px"
  height="281px"
  alt="The locking Script of an output Cell"
/>

To unlock this Cell for spending, Alice must provide a key (similar to the unlocking Script in BTC). In this case, Alice provides the numbers 3 and 5 in the `witnesses` field.

<img
  src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/ckb-witness.png"
  width="732px"
  height="379px"
  alt="The unlocking Script in the witnesses field"
/>

The following are the step-by-step breakdown of the verification process:

1. Load Witness data

- The values `v1` (3) and `v2` (5) are loaded from the `witnesses` field

  ```rust
  const v1 = load_value1_from_witness(); // number 3
  const v2 = load_value2_from_witness(); // number 5
  ```

  <img
    src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/execute-load-witness.png"
    width="700px"
    height="533px"
    alt="Witness data fetched and decoded into registers"
  />

2. Calculate the sum

- The Script calculates the sum of these two numbers.

  ```rust
  const result = v1 + v2; // 3 + 5 = 8
  ```

  <img
    src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/execute-check-sum.png"
    width="700px"
    height="533px"
    alt="Sum the two values"
  />

3. Check the condition

- If the previous`result` equals 8, the CKB-VM returns `0`
- Otherwise, the CKB-VM returns `1`

  ```rust
  if (result === 8) { return 0; }  // 8 === 8 in this case

  return 1;
  ```

  <img
    src="/img/ckb-vs-btc/execute-return-valid.png"
    width="700px"
    height="533px"
    alt="Return the final result"
  />

4. The CKB-VM interprets the return value: If the final result is `0`, the transaction is considered **valid;** Otherwise, the transaction is considered **invalid**. In this case, since 8 === 8, `0` is returned, and the transaction is valid.
