# OffCKB

[offckb](https://github.com/ckb-devrel/offckb) is a an all-in-one CLI tool that provides a local CKB development environment.

- Simplifies development with one-line command to start the devnet and create projects from boilerplate
- Comes with 20 pre-funded accounts and multiple minimal dApp templates for quick project setup
- Embeds common Scripts in the genesis block, such as Omnilock, xUDT, and Spore
- Provides a complete workflow from Script building and deployment to frontend integration for devnet
- Includes tools like ckb-debugger, molecule, and ckb-cli
- Features a REPL mode for quick Script testing
- Offers configurable settings via a JSON file
- Is built on and leverages CKB's JavaScript SDK, CCC, in the development framework

This guide will walk you through leveraging OffCKB to kickstart your first CKB project. The version used here is [`v0.3.0`](https://github.com/ckb-devrel/offckb/releases/tag/v0.3.0) or later.

## Get started

### Run CKB

Start a local blockchain with the default CKB version:

```
offckb node
```

Or, specify a CKB version:

```
offckb node 0.117.0
```

Or, set a default CKB version:

```
offckb config set ckb-version 0.117.0
offckb node
```

Once the Devnet is running, a RPC server will be available at `http://localhost:8114`.

An optional RPC proxy server runs at `http://localhost:9000`, forwarding requests to the RPC server. A proxy RPC server is for recording requests and automatically dumping failed transactions for later debugging.

The proxy server is optional. You can skip it by running:

```
offckb node --no-proxy
```

Alternatively, start the proxy server in a standalone terminal to better monitor the logs:

```
offckb proxy-rpc --ckb-rpc <http://localhost:8114> --port 9000 --network devnet
```

### Tweak Devnet Config

OffCKB provides a default configuration for the Devnet, which you can tweak as follows:

First, start your default CKB Devnet and locate the folder.

```bash
offckb node
# Once started, press Ctrl+C to stop the node
# Get the config
offckb config list
```

Result:

```json
{
  "devnet": {
    "rpcUrl": "<http://localhost:8114>",
    "configPath": "~/Library/Application Support/offckb-nodejs/devnet",
    "dataPath": "~/Library/Application Support/offckb-nodejs/devnet/data"
  }
}
```

Pay attention to the `devnet.configPath` and `devnet.dataPath`. They are the directories for configuration and chain data storage.

1. Navigate to `devnet.configPath`, which contains the configuration files for the local blockchain.

```bash
cd <path-to-devnet.configPath>
```

Modify the config files as needed to customize your Devnet. For guidance, see [Custom Devnet Setup](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/node/run-devnet-node#custom-devnet-setup) and [Configure CKB](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/develop/docs/configure.md) for a detailed explanation.

1. Once modified, clear the existing chain data in `devnet.dataPath`.

```
rm -rf <your-devnet.dataPath>
```

1. Restart the chain with new configurations by running `offckb node`.

Now your customized Devnet is ready to go.

### Create a Full-Stack Project

You can create a new project from predefined boilerplates with the following command:

```
offckb create <your-project-name, eg:my-first-ckb-project>
```

The fullstack boilerplate project is a monorepo that contains a script and a frontend project.

### Start the Frontend

To start the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder and run:

```
cd frontend && npm i & npm run dev
```

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkavbybzkg.png)

The boilerplate supports different CKB networks. Check the [README.md](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/docs.nervos.org/blob/develop/examples/remix-vite-template/readme.md) in the project for details.

### Create a Script-Only Project

You can create a new Script project without a frontend, which is useful when you only want to develop smart contracts for CKB.

```
offckb create <your-project-name> --script
```

:::Note

Make sure Rust/Cargo/Cargo-generate/Clang 16+ is installed in your environment, since OffCKB relies on [ckb-script-template](https://github.com/cryptape/ckb-script-templates) to handle the core process.

:::

### Build and Deploy a Script

To build the Script, navigate to the root of the project and run:

```
make build
```

To deploy, go to the frontend folder where the default `offckb.config.ts` is located and run:

```
cd frontend && offckb deploy --network <devnet/testnet>
```

Or specific the path to `offckb.config.ts` for deploy command to locate:

```
offckb deploy --network <devnet/testnet> --config <file-path-to-your-offckb.config.ts-file>
```

Pass `--type-id` to make Scripts upgradable. This is optional:

```
cd frontend && offckb deploy --type-id --network <devnet/testnet>
```

Once deployed, check the Scripts with following command:

```
offckb my-scripts --network <devnet/testnet>
```

The deployed Scripts will also be listed in the `frontend/offckb/my-scripts` folder in your frontend project. Also, `offckb.config.ts` will contain the integration details to import and utilize your Scripts in the frontend dApp.

### Use Deployed Scripts

Once deployed, use the Scripts as follows in your frontend:

```
import offckb from "offckb.config";

const myScriptDeps: CellDep[] = offCKB.myScripts["YOUR_SCRIPT_NAME"]!.cellDeps;
const myScript: Script = {
  codeHash: offCKB.myScripts["hash-lock"]!.codeHash,
  hashType: offCKB.myScripts["hash-lock"]!.hashType,
  args: lockArgs,
};

```

### Debug a Transaction

Failed transactions will be dumped and recorded by the proxy RPC server for later debugging.

To debug a transaction by its transaction hash, run the following command:

```
offckb debug <transaction-hash>
```

It will verify all the Scripts in the transaction and print the details in the terminal:

```
offckb debug --tx-hash 0x64c936ee78107450d49e57b7453dce9031ce68b056b2f1cdad5c2218ab7232ad

```

To debug a single Cell Script in a transaction, use the following command:

```
offckb debug <transaction-hash> --single-script <single-cell-script-option>
```

The `single-cell-script-option` format is `<cell-type>[<cell-index>].<script-type>`, eg: `"input[0].lock"`

- `cell-type` can be `input` or `output`, referring to the Cell type
- `cell-index` is the index of the Cell in the transaction
- `script-type` can be `lock` or `type` referring to the Script type

Or, you can replace the Script with a binary file in a single Cell Script debug session:

```
offckb debug <transaction-hash> --single-script <single-cell-script-option> --bin <path/to/binary/file>
```

All the debug utils are provided by [ckb-debugger](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-standalone-debugger/tree/develop/ckb-debugger).

### Generate Molecule Bindings

[Molecule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule) is the official [Serialization/Deserialization](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/serialization/serialization-molecule-in-ckb) system for CKB Scripts.

Define your data structure in `.mol` file (schema), and generate the bindings for different programming languages used in your project.

```
offckb mol --schema <path/to/mol/file> --output <path/to/output/file> --lang <lang>
```

Supported languages (`lang`): `ts`, `js`, `c`, `rs`, and `go`.

For multiple `.mol` files, use a folder as the input and specify an output folder:

```
offckb mol --schema <path/to/mol/folder> --output-folder <path/to/output/folder> --lang <lang>
```

## REPL Mode

OffCKB packs a custom Node.js REPL with built-in variables and functions to help you develop CKB in the terminal with minimized effort. This is most suitable for simple Script testing tasks when long code is not desirable.

### Start the OffCKB REPL

```
offckb repl --network <devnet/testnet/mainnet, default: devnet>

Welcome to OffCKB REPL!
[[ Default Network: devnet, enableProxyRPC: false ]]
Type 'help()' to learn how to use.
OffCKB >

```

Type `help()` to learn about the built-in variables and functions:

```
OffCKB > help()

OffCKB Repl, a Nodejs REPL with CKB bundles.

Global Variables to use:
  - ccc, cccA, imported from CKB Javascript SDK CCC
  - client, a CCC client instance bundle with current network
  - Client, a Wrap of CCC client class, you can build new client with
     const myClient = Client.new('devnet' | 'testnet' | 'mainnet');
     // or
     const myClient = Client.fromUrl('<your rpc url>', 'devnet' | 'testnet' | 'mainnet');
  - accounts, test accounts array from OffCKB
  - networks, network information configs
  - help, print this help message

```

### Build a CKB Transaction in REPL

```
OffCKB > let amountInCKB = ccc.fixedPointFrom(63);
OffCKB > let tx = ccc.Transaction.from({
...   outputs: [
...     {
...       capacity: ccc.fixedPointFrom(amountInCKB),
...       lock: accounts[0].lockScript,
...     },
...   ],
... });
OffCKB > let signer = new ccc.SignerCkbPrivateKey(client, accounts[0].privkey);
OffCKB > await tx.completeInputsByCapacity(signer);
2
OffCKB > await tx.completeFeeBy(signer, 1000);
[ 0, true ]
OffCKB > await mySigner.sendTransaction(tx)
'0x50fbfa8c47907d6842a325e85e48d5da6917e16ca7e2253ec3bd5bcdf8da99ce'

```

### Check Balance in REPL

```
OffCKB > let myClient = Client.fromUrl(networks.testnet.rpc_url, 'testnet');
OffCKB > await myClient.getBalanceSingle(accounts[0].lockScript);
60838485293944n
OffCKB >
```

## Configure Settings

OffCKB settings are saved in a JSON file, which you can edit to update your preferences.

### List All Settings

To view all available options and the JSON file path, run:

```
offckb config list
```

### Set CKB Version

```
offckb config get ckb-version
> 0.113.0
offckb config set ckb-version 0.117.0
offckb config get ckb-version

offckb config rm proxy
> save new settings
offckb config get proxy
> No Proxy.
```

## Pre-Funded Accounts

OffCKB comes with 20 pre-funded accounts, where each one has `42_000_000_00000000` capacity in the genesis block.

:::note

These accounts are for development only, do **NOT** send real assets into any of them.

:::

Run `offckb accounts` to print the details of these accounts:

```bash
Print account list, each account is funded with 42_000_000_00000000 capacity in the devnet genesis block.
