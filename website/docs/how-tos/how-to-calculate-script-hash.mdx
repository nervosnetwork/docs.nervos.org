# How to Calculate Script Hash

Script hash is calculated as follows:

```
ckbhash(molecule_encode(script))
```

Where:

- `ckbhash` is the BLAKE2b hash algorithm specifically used in CKB. For details, refer to [ckbhash](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/tech-explanation/ckbhash).

- `molecule_encode` serializes a structure into a binary format with the [Molecule serialization method](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/serialization/serialization-molecule-in-ckb)

The definition of Script is as follows:

```
table Script {
    code_hash:      Byte32,
    hash_type:      byte,
    args:           Bytes,
}
```
