# How to Sign a Transaction

In CKB, there are two primary <Tooltip>Lock Scripts</Tooltip> with distinct address code hash indexes:

- `0x00`: Pay to Public Key Hash (P2PKH)
- `0x01`: Pay to Multisignature (Multisig)

This how-to demonstrates how to sign P2PKH and multisig transactions.

Before you begin, ensure you have a solid grasp of:

- CKB transaction structure, as detailed in [RFC0022: CKB Transaction Structure](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md)
- CKB Address Format, as detailed in [RFC0021: CKB Address Format](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0021-ckb-address-format/0021-ckb-address-format.md#short-payload-format)

## P2PKH Signing

### Required Arguments

- **Private Key**: a secp256k1 private key
- **Witnesses**: contain transaction signatures

### Pseudo Code

```python
def sign_tx(pk, tx):
	# Group transaction inputs for signing
    input_groups = compute_input_groups(tx.inputs)

    # Iterate through each group of inputs
    for indexes in input_groups:
        group_index = indexes[0]

        # Create a placeholder for the lock field in the first witness of the group
        dummy_lock = [0] * 65 # Placeholder, assuming a 65-byte lock field

        # Retrieve and deserialize the first witness in the group
        witness = tx.witnesses[group_index]
        witness_args = witness.deserialize()

        # Replace the lock field with the dummy placeholder
        witness_args.lock = dummy_lock

        # Initialize a new BLAKE2b hasher for creating the signature hash
        hasher = new_blake2b()

        # Hash the transaction hash
        hasher.update(tx.hash())

        # Hash the first witness
        witness_len_bytes = len(serialize(witness_args)).to_le()
        assert(len(witness_len_bytes), 8)

        # Hash the length of witness
        hasher.update(witness_len_bytes)
        hasher.update(serialize(witness_args))

        # Hash the remaining witnesses in the group
        for i in indexes[1:]:
            witness = tx.witnesses[i]
            witness_len_bytes = len(witness).to_le()
            assert(len(witness_len_bytes), 8)
            hasher.update(witness_len_bytes)
            hasher.update(witness)

        # Hash additional witnesses not in any input group
        for witness in tx.witnesses[len(tx.inputs):]
            witness_len_bytes = len(witness).to_le()
            assert(len(witness_len_bytes), 8)
            hasher.update(witness_len_bytes)
            hasher.update(witness)

        # Finalize the hasher to get the signature hash
        sig_hash = hasher.finalize()

        # Sign the transaction with private key
        signature = pk.sign(sig_hash)

        # Replace the dummy lock field with the actual signature in the first witness
        witness_args.lock = signature

        # Serialize the updated witness_args and update the transaction's witnesses list
        tx.witnesses[group_index] = serialize(witness_args)
```

### Input group

:::note

This article focuses specifically on the input group associated with Lock Script. While there is a similar concept in <Tooltip>Type Script</Tooltip>, they will not be discussed here.

:::

CKB processes transactions by grouping inputs based on the `script_hash` of each input’s lock field, processing them collectively rather than individually.

For example, consider the following inputs:

```
inputs = [g1, g2, g1]
```

Here are three inputs, where the gN notation represents the group. `inputs[0]` and `inputs[2]` share the same group **g1**, while `inputs[1]` is in a different group **g2**. CKB runs the Lock Script on **g1** and **g2** separately. Understanding that the same `script_hash` implies identical lock fields of inputs, thus requiring only one signature per group.

The default locks, such as P2SH and multisig, assume there is a <Tooltip>witness</Tooltip> for each input group. The witness contains the signature and the default locks read the signature from the index of the first input. For **g1**, the signature is read from `witnesses[0]`, while for **g2**, from `witnesses[1]`.

The number of required witnesses corresponds to the number of input groups. For example:

- For inputs `[g1, g2, g1]`, two witnesses are needed: `[witness1, witness2]`.
- For inputs `[g1, g2, g1, g3]`, four witnesses are needed, including an empty byte to align `witness3` for **g3**: `[witness1, witness2, (empty bytes), witness3]`.
- For inputs `[g1, g2, g2, g1]`, two witnesses are needed: `[witness1, witness2]`.

A helper function grouping inputs by their `script_hash` and returning the indexes could look like this:

```
def compute_input_groups(inputs):
		groups = defaultdict(list)
		for i, input in enumerate(inputs):
				script_hash = blake256(serialize(input.lock))
				groups[script_hash].append(i)

		return groups.values()
```

### Witness

The witness field of a transaction holds signatures, which are read by P2PKH Lock Scripts.

### WitnessArgs

[`WitnessArgs`](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/eece5d0c250e0ae0644f9ca9a3f13dab7d7c936c/util/gen-types/schemas/blockchain.mol#L114-L118) allows Lock Script and <Tooltip>Type Script</Tooltip> to read data from different fields of WitnessArgs.

The default P2PKH and the multisig Scripts require user to use `WitnessArgs` on the first `witness` of each group.

:::info

In CKB, `witnesses` is extended to allow users to include any one-time data necessary solely for the transaction’s verification process. However, this flexibility brings a problem, a transaction's Lock Script and Type Script may require different data from the same witness, there is a risk that neither script’s requirement can be met at the same time, potentially causing the transaction permanently locked.

To dismiss this potential conflict, `WitnessArgs` is introduced to allow Lock Script and Type Script to read data from different fields in the `WitnessArgs`.

## Multisig Signing

Much like P2PKH transactions, multisig signing is about providing signatures in witnesses to unlock the input. Plus, with each input group isolated, a single transaction can combine both multisig and P2PKH signing methods.

### Required Arguments

- **Private Keys**: a set of secp256k1 private keys
- **Witnesses**: contain transaction signatures
- **Multisig Script**: a Script defining the multisig constraint

### Pseudo Code

```python
def sign_tx(pks, tx, multisig_script):
	# Group the transaction inputs for signing
    input_groups = compute_input_groups(tx.inputs)

    # Iterate through each group of inputs
    for indexes in input_groups:
        group_index = indexes[0]

        # Extract the required number of signatures 'm' from the multisig script
        m = multisig_script[2]

        # Create a dummy lock field with space for 'm' signatures
        dummy_lock = multisig_script + [0] * 65 * m

        # Deserialize the first witness and replace its lock field with the dummy lock
        witness = tx.witnesses[group_index]
        witness_args = witness.deserialize()
        witness_args.lock = dummy_lock

        # Initialize a new BLAKE2b hasher for the signature hash
        hasher = new_blake2b()

        # Hash the tx hash
        hasher.update(tx.hash())

        # Hash the first witness
        witness_len_bytes = len(serialize(witness_args)).to_le()
        assert(len(witness_len_bytes), 8)

        # Hash the length of witness
        hasher.update(witness_len_bytes)
        hasher.update(serialize(witness_args))

        # Hash the remaining witnesses in the group
        for i in indexes[1:]:
            witness = tx.witnesses[i]
            witness_len_bytes = len(witness).to_le()
            assert(len(witness_len_bytes), 8)
            hasher.update(witness_len_bytes)
            hasher.update(witness)

        # Hash additional witnesses not in any input group
        for witness in tx.witnesses[len(tx.inputs):]
            witness_len_bytes = len(witness).to_le()
            assert(len(witness_len_bytes), 8)
            hasher.update(witness_len_bytes)
            hasher.update(witness)

        # Finalize the hasher to get the signature hash
        sig_hash = hasher.finalize()

        # Sign the transaction with each private key
        for (i, pk) in enumerate(pks):
            signature = pk.sign(sig_hash)

            # Place each signature in the appropriate position in the dummy lock field
            sig_offset = len(multisig_script) + i * 65 # Calculate the starting index for the signature
            witness_args.lock[sig_offset:sig_offset + 65] = signature
        # Serialize the updated witness arguments and update the transaction's witnesses list
        tx.witnesses[group_index] = serialize(witness_args)
```

### Multisig Script

The multisig script hash is a 20-byte blake160 hash, assembled as follows:

```
S | R | M | N | blake160(Pubkey1) | blake160(Pubkey2) | ...
```

Here, `S`/ `R`/ `M`/ `N` are four single byte unsigned integers, ranging from 0 to 255.

- `S` is format version, set to 0.
- `R` specifies that at least R of the provided signatures must match the first R items of the public key list.
- `M` and `N` indicate the required number of signatures, M of N, to unlock the cell.
- `blake160 (Pubkey1)` represents the first 160 bits of the blake2b hash of secp256K1 compressed public keys.

For example, if Alice, Bob, and Cipher collectively control a multisig-locked cell with the unlocking rule "any two of us can unlock the cell, and one must be Cipher’s". The corresponding multisig script is:

```
0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | Pk_Cipher_h | Pk_Alice_h | Pk_Bob_h
```

To sign a transaction, the multisig script must be revealed in the witness field, followed by the corresponding signatures:

```
multisig_script | Signature1 | Signature2 | ...
```

### Since

The `since` field introduces a timelock constraint, dictating when the multisig lock can be unlocked. It is typically empty, indicating that there is no temporal restriction on unlocking the lock, allowing immediate access.
