title: Tips for CKB development
---
[Nervos CKB](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb) is the layer 1 of Nervos Network, a public/permissionless blockchain, which is an open source project on github. There are some tips for ckb development below, hope it will be useful for you.


## Molecule

We have developed a particular serialization format called **Molecule**.It is recommended to check the [molecule github repo](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/molecule) for more details.

## Well-known Hashes

The command `ckb list-hashes` prints the well-known hashes for current
effective chain spec.

The file `docs/hashes.toml` in ckb release package and source code repository
contains the well-known hashes for all the bundled chain specs. The file is
generated by:

```
cargo run list-hashes -b > docs/hashes.toml
```

## Running Test

Install dependencies

```
rustup component add rustfmt
rustup component add clippy
```

Run tests

```
make ci
```

Run acceptance integration tests

```
make integration
```

## Debug CKB

**Note: Only support linux system.**

### Track Memory Usage in Logs

Add the follow configuration into `ckb.toml`:

```toml
[logger]
filter = "error,ckb-memory-tracker=trace"

[memory_tracker]
# Seconds between checking the process, 0 is disable, default is 0.
interval = 600
```

### Profile Memory

- Compile `ckb` with feature `profiling`.

  ```sh
  make build-for-profiling
  ```

  After compiling, a script named `jeprof` will be generated in `target` direcotry.

  ```sh
  find target/ -name "jeprof"
  ```

- Enable RPC module `Debug` in `ckb.toml`.

  ```toml
  [rpc]
  modules = ["Debug"]
  ```

- Run `ckb`.

- Dump memory usage to a file via call RPC `jemalloc_profiling_dump`.

  ```sh
  curl -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{ "id": 2, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "jemalloc_profiling_dump", "params": [] }' http://localhost:8114
  ```

  Then, a file named `ckb-jeprof.$TIMESTAMP.heap` will be generated in the working directory of the running `ckb`.

- Generate a PDF of the call graph.

  **Required**: graphviz and ghostscript

  ```sh
  jeprof --show_bytes --pdf target/debug/ckb ckb-jeprof.$TIMESTAMP.heap > call-graph.pdf
  ```
