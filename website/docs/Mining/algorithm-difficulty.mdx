# Algorithm and Difficulty Adjustment

CKB uses the [NC-MAX](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1101) consensus, an advancement of the Nakamoto consensus, with the independently developed mining algorithm, Eaglesong.

Introductions to the Eaglesong algorithm:

- [Introducing Eaglesong, Nervos’s New Hash Function for CKB Proof-of-Work](https://medium.com/nervosnetwork/the-proof-of-work-function-of-nervos-ckb-3cc8364464d9)
- [Nervos RFC 0010 Eaglesong](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0010-eaglesong/0010-eaglesong.md)
- [Rust Library on Github](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/eaglesong)

Mining difficulty adjusts with each [Epoch](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/concepts/glossary#epoch), approximately every 4 hours. The adjustment covers:

- Current block time adjustment range: 8s ~ 48s
- Target uncle block rate: 2.5%
