# Run a Mainnet Node

Running a Mainnet node allows you to participate directly in the live blockchain, supporting the network's operation and integrity. This guide will cover the steps needed to set up and run a mainnet node on CKB, which is ideal for those looking to be actively involved in the network's governance and day-to-day activities. We suggest a minimum of 100GB of local storage for this purpose.

## Step 1: Download CKB Binary

:::info

We will use **ckb_v0.115.0** for this guide. Please ensure you download the latest version corresponding to your operating system.

:::

Get the latest CKB binary from [Github releases](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases).

## Step 2: Navigate to CKB Directory

Unzip the downloaded file to an easily accessible folder, e.g., C:\ckb for Windows, ~/Documents for Mac. Open your terminal/command line and navigate to your CKB directory using the following command:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="Mac">
```

```bash
  cd /Users/(NAME)/Documents/ckb_v0.115.0-rc3_aarch64-apple-darwin-portable/ckb
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
```

```bash
  cd C:/ckb_v0.115.0_x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Step 3: Verify versions

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="check-version" label="Command">
```

```bash
  ckb --version
  ckb-cli --version
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="verify-version" label="Result">
```

```bash
  ckb 0.115.0 (d845cbf 2024-04-01)
  ckb-cli 1.8.0-rc1 (cf4159b 2024-03-28)
```

```mdx-code-block
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Step 4: Initialize Node

```bash
  ckb init --chain mainnet
```

## Step 5: Start the CKB Mainnet Node

```bash
  ckb run
```

By following these steps, you've successfully started a CKB node connected to the mainnet. This node will participate in the network, contributing to its security and robustness.

## Track Your Node

Track your node using [CKB Node Probe](https://nodes.ckb.dev/) and view the global distribution of active CKB nodes.
