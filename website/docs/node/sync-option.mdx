title: Sync Options

When running a CKB full node, there are multiple ways to sync blockchain data to your local machine. Each method offers trade-offs between trust, performance, and convenience.

## Option 1: Sync from P2P

This is the default and recommended approach, as described in [Run a Mainnet Node](/docs/node/run-mainnet-node).

How it works:

- Downloads blocks, headers, and state from other nodes over the P2P network.
- Validates each piece of data as it arrives.

```bash
ckb init --chain mainnet
ckb run
```

If you're using a Unix-like system, run `./ckb init --chain mainnet` and `./ckb run` instead.

## Option 2: Copy Database + Replay

Used when you have access to a trusted, already-synced node, such as https://ckb-data.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/ckb-mainnet-0.201.0-2025-04-23.tar.gz.

How it works:

- You copy the entire `data/` directory from a trusted node.
- `ckb replay` verifies the db integrity based on the local chain spec.

To verify the integrity of the `data/` directory and write temporary output to the current directory, run:

```bash
ckb replay --tmp-target ./  --sanity-check
```

If you're using a Unix-like system, run `./ckb replay --tmp-target ./ --sanity-check` instead.
Note that the `data/` directory must exist in your current directory. If it's located elsewhere, use `-C <path>` to point to the correct config directory.

## Option 3: Import & Export

Use this method for backup or migrating chain data across machines.

How it works:

- `ckb export` saves the chain data from genesis to tip into a file.
- `ckb import` loads and re-validates that data into a new node.

### Export

You need to shut down your node before running `ckb export`

```bash
ckb export --target mainnet_export.dat
```

You can name the file anything you likeâ€”`mainnet_export` is just an example.
If you're using a Unix-like system, run `./ckb export --target mainnet_export.dat` instead.

### Import

```bash
ckb import <source-path>
```

`<source-path>` is the path to the `.dat` file you want to import.
If you're using a Unix-like system, run `./ckb import <source-path>` instead.

## Comparison Summary

| Method              | Trust Model         | Speed  | Validation | Use Case                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `ckb run`           | Trustless           | Slow   | Full       | First-time sync, safest and standard |
| `ckb replay`        | Trusted source      | Medium | Full       | Internal sync, faster bootstrapping  |
| `ckb import/export` | Portable file-based | Slow   | Full       | Migration, backup, offline sync      |
