# RPCs
CKB RPCs are a set of programming interfaces provided by the Nervos CKB blockchain, enabling developers to interact with the network for querying data, managing transactions, and deploying smart contracts directly.

## RPC Provider: Ankr
Ankr is an RPC provider that wors as intermediary to help you interact with the Nervos Network. You might experience some levels of latency depending on the provider’s location.
Ankr’s endpoint root: [https://rpc.ankr.com/nervos](https://rpc.ankr.com/nervos)

## CKB JSON-RPC Protocols
CKB exposes a set of RPCs in [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) protocols for interactions. For more details, please refer to [CKB JSON RPC Protocols Documentation](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/master/rpc/README.md).

:::tip
- The RPCs exposed by CKB are only designed for internal usage. Please limit the access to the CKB RPCs strictly to trusted machines (by using rpc.listen_address configuration option). Exposing CKB RPCs to the public Internet is dangerous and strongly discouraged.
- CKB JSON-RPC only supports HTTP now. If you need SSL support, please setup a reverse proxy via nginx or other HTTPS servers.
- Subscriptions require a full duplex connection. CKB offers such connections in the form of tcp (enable with rpc.tcp_listen_address configuration option) and websockets (enable with rpc.ws_listen_address), plain HTTP connection does not support subscriptions. See below for examples on this.

### Prerequisite
To use CKB JSON-RPC, you must first have a node running, please refer to existing guides on how to run a CKB Mainnet node, a CKB Testnet node, or a development-only CKB blockchain. The commands below also assumes you are exposing CKB JSON-RPC on the default 8114 port. If you are starting CKB JSON-RPC on a different port, please make changes accordingly.
