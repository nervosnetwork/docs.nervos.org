title: Join Nervos
---

We are looking for forward-thinking builders who believe in the transformative power of blockchain to reshape industries and empower communities.

Join us in redefining a future where **trust is hardcoded into the digital world**.

## Proof-of-Contribution

Instead of traditional hiring, Nervos is building its team through community contributions.

Our **Proof-of-Contribution (POC)** model lets both contributors and the team evaluate long-term compatibility through real projects.

Your **open-source contributions are the pathway** to joining the Nervos ecosystem. Real contributions—no matter how small—are the best way to get noticed by the team.

If you’re new to blockchain, start by learning about [_How CKB Works_](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/getting-started/how-ckb-works)

## Become a Nervos Builder

For experienced developers eager to get involved, we invite you to engage directly to our open-source projects.

- [**CKB-VM**](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-vm): the virtual machine powering CKB smart contracts
- [**Fiber Network**](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/fiber): the p2p payment network on CKB
