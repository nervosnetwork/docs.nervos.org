# Build a Simple Lock

<TutorialHeader time={"10 - 15 min"} tools={"dapp"} />

## Tutorial Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a full-stack dApp, including both the frontend and the Script, to deepen your understanding of CKB blockchain development.

Our example dApp will use a simple toy lock. You will create a <Tooltip>Lock Script</Tooltip> named `hash_lock` to secure some CKB tokens and build a web interface for users to transfer tokens from this `hash_lock`.

The `hash_lock` project involves specifying a hash in the Script's <Tooltip>script_args</Tooltip>. To unlock it, users must provide the preimage that matches this hash.

:::note
This toy lock example isn't intended for production. Use it ONLY in Testnet or Devnet as a starting point for learning the basics.

## Setup Devnet & Run Example

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started with the tutorial dApp, clone the repository and navigate to the appropriate directory using the following commands:

```bash {2}
git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/docs.nervos.org.git
cd docs.nervos.org/examples/dApp/simple-lock
```

### Step 2: Start the Devnet

<StartDevnet />

### Step 3: Build and Deploy the Script

In this tutorial, the `hash-lock` contract is implemented in **TypeScript**.

To compile the TypeScript contract, navigate to the `root` directory and run:

<CodeTabs
  cmd={`pnpm install
pnpm build`}
  response={`> node scripts/build-all.js

Building 1 contract(s): hash-lock

📦 Building contract: hash-lock
Building hash-lock from contracts/hash-lock/src/index.ts...
📦 Bundling with esbuild...
🔧 Compiling to bytecode...
✅ Contract 'hash-lock' built successfully!
📄 JavaScript: dist/hash-lock.js
🔗 Bytecode: dist/hash-lock.bc
✅ Successfully built: hash-lock

🎉 All contracts built successfully!
`}
/>

Once compiled, the contract files will be available in the `simple-lock/dist` directory.

Deploy the Script binary to the Devnet:

<CodeTabs
  cmd={`pnpm run deploy --network devnet`}
  response={`> node scripts/build-all.js && node scripts/deploy.js "--network" "devnet"

Building 1 contract(s): hash-lock

💡 Next steps:

- Check the deployment artifacts in the deployment/ folder
- Run your tests to use the deployed contract scripts`}
  />

The deployment artifacts will be saved to the `examples/simple-lock/deployment` directory.

### Step 4: Run the DApp

Next, you need to copy the `scripts.json` file from `deployment` folder to the `frontend/deployment` directory.

Then, navigate to the frontend folder, install the node dependencies, and start running the example:

<CodeTabs
  cmd={
`cd frontend && npm i && npm run dev`
  }
  response={
`> frontend@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

▲ Next.js 14.2.3

- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env

✓ Starting...
✓ Ready in 1631ms
`
}
/>

Now, the app is running in http://localhost:3000.

At the top of the page, developers can select their preferred language based on their needs.

### Step 5: Deposit Some CKB

With our dApp up and running, you can now input a hash value to construct a `hash_lock` Script. To utilize this `hash_lock` Script, we need to prepare some <Tooltip>Live Cells</Tooltip> that use this Script as their Lock Script. This preparation process is known as **deposit**. We can use `offckb` to quickly deposit to any CKB address. Here's an example of how to deposit 300 CKB into a specific address:

<CodeTabs
  cmd={`offckb deposit --network devnet ckt1qp02fww4qzf6rx2rm3ugc9dmma7dnky7l4ne3xsck930aj5pfkgtkqgqqpdsmqftz49xmjqgm2yr0ejj5jpsgw9w6vtazlaukdf9xecu4z32kqgsdyg7f7p70y8pavhnn00ly0qaksldttujr8mk8et38zd0yyjeegxctl4m 300`}
  response={`tx hash:  0x0668292c875ee31906e48651a553a16158307c02f2e91d24be75166ca080e1fd`}
/>

Once you've deposited some CKB into the `hash_lock` CKB address, you can attempt to transfer some balance from this address to another. This will allow you to test the `hash_lock` Script and see if it functions as expected.

You can try clicking the **"Transfer"** button. The website will prompt you to enter the preimage value. If the preimage is correct, the transaction will be accepted on-chain. If not, the transaction will fail because our `hash_lock` Script rejects the incorrect preimage and works as expected.

## Behind the Scene

### Script Logic

Here’s what the script does step-by-step:

1. It reads the **expected hash** from the Script's `args` field.
2. It retrieves the **preimage** from the transaction’s **witness** field.
3. It computes the **hash** of the preimage using the default CKB hash function (`blake2b-256`).
4. If the computed hash matches the one in the `script_args`, the script returns success (0). Otherwise, it fails.

Here is the complete `hash_lock` script logic:

```typescript
import * as bindings from "@ckb-js-std/bindings";
import { HighLevel, log, hashCkb, bytesEq } from "@ckb-js-std/core";

function main() {
  log.setLevel(log.LogLevel.Debug);
  let expect_hash = new Uint8Array(HighLevel.loadScript().args).slice(35);

  let witness_args = HighLevel.loadWitnessArgs(0, bindings.SOURCE_GROUP_INPUT);
  let preimage = witness_args.lock!;

  let hash = hashCkb(preimage);

  if (!bytesEq(hash, expect_hash.buffer)) {
    log.error(`Check hash failed: ${new Uint8Array(hash)}, ${expect_hash}`);
    return 11;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}

bindings.exit(main());
```

A few key things to highlight for developers coming from the JavaScript ecosystem:

- The `@ckb-js-std/core` and `bindings` libraries provide high-level syscalls for accessing blockchain data.
- `HighLevel.loadScript()` gets the current Script, and `.args` retrieves the expected hash.
- `HighLevel.loadWitnessArgs()` fetches the witness for the transaction input, where the preimage is stored.
- `hashCkb()` is used to calculate the `blake2b-256` hash.
- If the hash matches, the script returns `0`. Otherwise, it logs the error and returns a failure code (`11`).

This approach demonstrates how to write on-chain logic in a developer-friendly TypeScript environment, allowing you to test and iterate quickly with familiar tooling.

### Use the Hash_Lock Script in Your DApp

Let's take a look at the `generateAccount` function: It accepts a hash string parameter. This hash string is used as `script_args` to build a `hash_lock` Script. This Script can then be used as the lock to secure CKB tokens.

One thing to note here is that our script is a JavaScript contract, so it needs to run inside the `ckb-js-vm` Script. That's why we pass the script `code_hash` and `hash_type` as a `args` to the `ckb-js-vm` Script.

```ts title='simple-lock/frontend/app/hash-lock.ts'
// ...
export function generateAccount(hash: string) {
  const lockArgs =
    "0x0000" +
    myScripts["hash-lock.bc"]!.codeHash.slice(2) +
    hexFrom(hashTypeToBytes(myScripts["hash-lock.bc"]!.hashType)).slice(2) +
    hash;
  const lockScript = {
    codeHash: mySystemScripts["ckb_js_vm"]!.script.codeHash,
    hashType: mySystemScripts["ckb_js_vm"]!.script.hashType,
    args: lockArgs,
  };
  const address = ccc.Address.fromScript(lockScript, cccClient).toString();
  return {
    address,
    lockScript: ccc.Script.from(lockScript),
  };
}
// ...
```

Another important aspect of the `generateAccount` function is that it also returns a CKB address. This address is computed from the Lock Script using CCC utils `ccc.Address.fromScript`. Essentially, the CKB address is just the encoded version of the Lock Script.

Think of it like a safe deposit box. The address is like the serial number of the lock (used to identify the lock) on top of the safe box. When you deposit CKB tokens into a CKB address, it's like depositing money into a specific safe box with a specific lock.

When we talk about how much balance a CKB address holds, we're simply referring to how much value a specific lock secures. The balance (capacities) calculation function in our frontend code works by collecting the Live Cells that use a specific Lock Script and summing their capacities.

```ts title='simple-lock/frontend/app/hash-lock.ts'
// ...
export async function capacityOf(address: string): Promise<bigint> {
  const addr = await ccc.Address.fromString(address, cccClient);
  let balance = await cccClient.getBalance([addr.script]);
  return balance;
}
// ...
```

To transfer (or unlock) CKB from this `hash_lock` Script address, we need to build a CKB transaction that consumes some Live Cells which use the `hash_lock` Script and generates new Live Cells which use the receiver's Lock Script. Additionally, in the witness field of the transaction, we need to provide the preimage for the hash value in the `hash_lock` Script args to prove that we are indeed the owner of the `hash_lock` Script (since only the owner knows the preimage).

We use CCC to build such a transaction.

```ts title='simple-lock/frontend/app/hash-lock.ts'
// ...
export async function unlock(
  fromAddr: string,
  toAddr: string,
  amountInCKB: string
): Promise<string> {
  const fromScript = (await ccc.Address.fromString(fromAddr, cccClient)).script;
  const toScript = (await ccc.Address.fromString(toAddr, cccClient)).script;
  const readSigner = new ccc.SignerCkbScriptReadonly(cccClient, fromScript);

  // Build the full transaction
  const tx = ccc.Transaction.from({
    outputs: [{ lock: toScript }],
    outputsData: [],
  });

  // CCC transactions are easy to be edited
  tx.outputs.forEach((output, i) => {
    if (output.capacity > ccc.fixedPointFrom(amountInCKB)) {
      alert(`Insufficient capacity at output ${i} to store data`);
      return;
    }
    output.capacity = ccc.fixedPointFrom(amountInCKB);
  });

  // fill the witness with preimage
  const preimageAnswer = window.prompt("please enter the preimage: ");
  if (preimageAnswer == null) {
    throw new Error("user abort input!");
  }
  const newWitnessArgs = new ccc.WitnessArgs(
    stringToBytesHex(preimageAnswer) as `0x${string}`
  );
  console.log("newWitnessArgs: ", newWitnessArgs);
  tx.setWitnessArgsAt(0, newWitnessArgs);

  // Complete missing parts for transaction
  await tx.addCellDeps(offCKB.myScripts["hash-lock"]!.cellDeps[0].cellDep);
  await tx.completeInputsByCapacity(
    readSigner,
    ccc.fixedPointFrom(amountInCKB)
  );
  const balanceDiff =
    (await tx.getInputsCapacity(cccClient)) - tx.getOutputsCapacity();
  console.log("balanceDiff: ", balanceDiff);
  if (balanceDiff > ccc.Zero) {
    tx.addOutput({
      lock: fromScript,
    });
  }
  //await tx.completeFeeBy(readSigner, 1000);

  const txHash = await cccClient.sendTransaction(tx);
  console.log("Full transaction: ", tx.stringify());
  return txHash;
}
```

### Is the Hash_Lock Safe to Use?

The short answer is no. The `hash_lock` is not very secure for guarding your CKB tokens. Some of you might already know the reason, but here are some points to consider:

- **Miner Front-running**: Since the preimage value is revealed in the witness, once you submit the transaction to the blockchain, miners can see this preimage and construct a new transaction to transfer the tokens to their addresses before you do.
- **Balance Vulnerability**: Once you transfer part of the balance from the `hash_lock` address, the preimage value is revealed on-chain. This makes the remaining tokens locked in the `hash_lock` vulnerable since anyone who sees the preimage can steal them.

Even though using a hash and preimage is too simple to be a secure Lock Script, it’s a great starting point for learning. The goal is to understand how CKB Scripts work and gain experience with CKB development.
