# Build a Simple Lock

<TutorialHeader time={"10 - 15 min"} tools={"script"} />

## Tutorial Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a full-stack dApp, including both the frontend and the Script, to deepen your understanding of CKB blockchain development.

Our example dApp will use a simple toy lock. You will create a <Tooltip>Lock Script</Tooltip> named `hash_lock` to secure some CKB tokens and build a web interface for users to transfer tokens from this `hash_lock`.

The `hash_lock` project involves specifying a hash in the Script's <Tooltip>script_args</Tooltip>. To unlock it, users must provide the preimage that matches this hash.

:::note
This toy lock example isn't intended for production. Use it ONLY n Testnet as an starting point for learning the basics.
:::

## Setup Devnet & Run Example

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get started with the tutorial dApp, clone the repository and navigate to the appropriate directory using the following commands:

```bash {2}
git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/docs.nervos.org.git
cd docs.nervos.org/examples/simple-lock
```

### Step 2: Start the Devnet

<StartDevnet />

### Step 3: Build and Deploy the Script

Navigate to your project, compile and deploy the Script to Devnet.

Compile the Script:

<CodeTabs
  cmd={`make build`}
  response={`Cleaning build/release directory...
mkdir -p build/release
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+zba,+zbb,+zbc,+zbs --cfg debug_assertions" TARGET_CC="clang"
                cargo build --target=riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf --release 
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.22s
Copying binary hash-lock to build directory`}
/>

Deploy the Script binary to the Devnet:

<CodeTabs
  cmd={`cd frontend && offckb deploy --network devnet`}
  response={`contract HASH-LOCK deployed, tx hash: 0x9f55da2b555cdc4412945ff8827b7e77508c84f0b85d82b027d31418e6a9b5d9
wait 4 blocks..
done.
`}
/>

### Step 4: Run the DApp

Navigate to your project's frontend folder, install the node dependencies, and start running the example:

<CodeTabs
  cmd={
`cd frontend && npm i && npm run dev`
  }
  response={
`> frontend@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

▲ Next.js 14.2.3

- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Environments: .env

✓ Starting...
✓ Ready in 1631ms
`
}
/>

Now, the app is running in http://localhost:3000

### Step 5: Deposit Some CKB

With our dApp up and running, you can now input a hash value to construct a `hash_lock` Script. To utilize this `hash_lock` Script, we need to prepare some <Tooltip>Live Cells</Tooltip> that use this Script as their Lock Script. This preparation process is known as **deposit**. We can use `offckb` to quickly deposit to any CKB address. Here's an example of how to deposit 100 CKB into a specific address:

<CodeTabs
  cmd={`offckb deposit --network devnet ckt1qry2mh3j5cylve2tl2sjpg3zhp9wjeq2l92rvxtd2scsx4jks500xpqrnm4k4g7j8nlnyc0j3y3z5q6s5ns29k8wx9prkn8ff09mhepmagkhur6h 10000000000`}
  response={`tx hash:  0x0668292c875ee31906e48651a553a16158307c02f2e91d24be75166ca080e1fd`}
/>

Once you've deposited some CKB into the `hash_lock` CKB address, you can attempt to transfer some balance from this address to another. This will allow you to test the `hash_lock` Script and see if it functions as expected.

You can try clicking the **"Transfer"** button. The website will prompt you to enter the preimage value. If the preimage is correct, the transaction will be accepted on-chain. If not, the transaction will fail because our `hash_lock` Script rejects the incorrect preimage and works as expected.

## Behind the Scene

### Script Logic

The concept behind `hash_lock` is to specify a hash in a particular Script. To unlock this Script, you must provide the preimage to reveal the hash. More specifically, the `hash_lock` Script will execute the following validations on-chain:

- First, the Script will read the preimage value from the transaction witness field.
- Second, the Script will take the preimage and hash it using `ckb-default-hash` based on `blake-2b-256`.
- Lastly, the Script will compare the hash generated from the preimage with the hash value from the `script_args`. If the two match, it returns 0 as success; otherwise, it fails.

To gain a better understanding, let's examine the full Script code. Open the `main.rs` file in the `contracts` folder:

```rust title='simple-lock/contracts/hash-lock/src/main.rs'
#![no_std]
#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_main)]

#[cfg(test)]
extern crate alloc;

use ckb_hash::blake2b_256;
use ckb_std::ckb_constants::Source;

#[cfg(not(test))]
use ckb_std::default_alloc;
use ckb_std::error::SysError;
#[cfg(not(test))]
ckb_std::entry!(program_entry);
#[cfg(not(test))]
default_alloc!();

#[repr(i8)]
pub enum Error {
    IndexOutOfBound = 1,
    ItemMissing,
    LengthNotEnough,
    Encoding,
    // Add customized errors here...
    CheckError,
    UnMatch,
}

impl From<SysError> for Error {
    fn from(err: SysError) -> Self {
        match err {
            SysError::IndexOutOfBound => Self::IndexOutOfBound,
            SysError::ItemMissing => Self::ItemMissing,
            SysError::LengthNotEnough(_) => Self::LengthNotEnough,
            SysError::Encoding => Self::Encoding,
            SysError::Unknown(err_code) => panic!("unexpected sys error {}", err_code),
        }
    }
}

pub fn program_entry() -> i8 {
    ckb_std::debug!("This is a sample contract!");

    match check_hash() {
        Ok(_) => 0,
        Err(err) => err as i8,
    }
}

pub fn check_hash() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let script = ckb_std::high_level::load_script()?;
    let expect_hash = script.args().raw_data().to_vec();

    let witness_args = ckb_std::high_level::load_witness_args(0, Source::GroupInput)?;
    let preimage = witness_args
        .lock()
        .to_opt()
        .ok_or(Error::CheckError)?
        .raw_data();

    let hash = blake2b_256(preimage.as_ref());

    if hash.eq(&expect_hash.as_ref()) {
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err(Error::UnMatch)
    }
}
```

Here are a few things to note:

- In the `check_hash()` function, we use `ckb_std::high_level::load_witness_args` syscalls to read the preimage value from the witness fieled in the CKB transaction. The structure used in the witness fieled here is the `witnessArgs`.
- We then use the CKB default hash function `blake2b_256` from the `use ckb_hash::blake2b_256` library to hash the preimage and get its hash value.
- Next, we compare the two hash values to see if they match `(hash.eq(&expect_hash.as_ref()))`. If they do not match, we return a custom error code `Error::UnMatch` (which is 6).

The whole logic is quite simple and straightforward. How do we use such a Script in our dApp? Let's check the frontend code.

### Use the Hash_Lock Script in Your DApp

Let's take a look at the `generateAccount` function: It accepts a hash string parameter. This hash string is used as `script_args` to build a `hash_lock` Script. This Script can then be used as the lock to secure CKB tokens.

Note that we can directly use `offCKB.myScripts["hash-lock"]` to get the `code_hash` and `hash_type` information, thanks to the `offckb` templates.

```ts title='simple-lock/frontend/app/hash-lock.ts'
// ...
export function generateAccount(hash: string) {
  const lockArgs = "0x" + hash;
  const lockScript = {
    codeHash: offCKB.myScripts["hash-lock"]!.codeHash,
    hashType: offCKB.myScripts["hash-lock"]!.hashType,
    args: lockArgs,
  };
  const address = ccc.Address.fromScript(lockScript, cccClient).toString();
  return {
    address,
    lockScript: ccc.Script.from(lockScript),
  };
}
// ...
```

Another important aspect of the `generateAccount` function is that it also returns a CKB address. This address is computed from the Lock Script using CCC utils `ccc.Address.fromScript`. Essentially, the CKB address is just the encoded version of the Lock Script.

Think of it like a safe deposit box. The address is like the serial number of the lock (used to identify the lock) on top of the safe box. When you deposit CKB tokens into a CKB address, it's like depositing money into a specific safe box with a specific lock.

When we talk about how much balance a CKB address holds, we're simply referring to how much value a specific lock secures. The balance (capacities) calculation function in our frontend code works by collecting the Live Cells that use a specific Lock Script and summing their capacities.

```ts title='simple-lock/frontend/app/hash-lock.ts'
// ...
export async function capacityOf(address: string): Promise<bigint> {
  const addr = await ccc.Address.fromString(address, cccClient);
  let balance = await cccClient.getBalance([addr.script]);
  return balance;
}
// ...
```

To transfer (or unlock) CKB from this `hash_lock` Script address, we need to build a CKB transaction that consumes some Live Cells which use the `hash_lock` Script and generates new Live Cells which use the receiver's Lock Script. Additionally, in the witness field of the transaction, we need to provide the preimage for the hash value in the `hash_lock` Script args to prove that we are indeed the owner of the `hash_lock` Script (since only the owner knows the preimage).

We use CCC to build such a transaction.

```ts title='simple-lock/frontend/app/hash-lock.ts'
// ...
export async function unlock(
  fromAddr: string,
  toAddr: string,
  amountInCKB: string
): Promise<string> {
  const fromScript = (await ccc.Address.fromString(fromAddr, cccClient)).script;
  const toScript = (await ccc.Address.fromString(toAddr, cccClient)).script;
  const readSigner = new ccc.SignerCkbScriptReadonly(cccClient, fromScript);

  // Build the full transaction
  const tx = ccc.Transaction.from({
    outputs: [{ lock: toScript }],
    outputsData: [],
  });

  // CCC transactions are easy to be edited
  tx.outputs.forEach((output, i) => {
    if (output.capacity > ccc.fixedPointFrom(amountInCKB)) {
      alert(`Insufficient capacity at output ${i} to store data`);
      return;
    }
    output.capacity = ccc.fixedPointFrom(amountInCKB);
  });

  // fill the witness with preimage
  const preimageAnswer = window.prompt("please enter the preimage: ");
  if (preimageAnswer == null) {
    throw new Error("user abort input!");
  }
  const newWitnessArgs = new ccc.WitnessArgs(
    stringToBytesHex(preimageAnswer) as `0x${string}`
  );
  console.log("newWitnessArgs: ", newWitnessArgs);
  tx.setWitnessArgsAt(0, newWitnessArgs);

  // Complete missing parts for transaction
  await tx.addCellDeps(offCKB.myScripts["hash-lock"]!.cellDeps[0].cellDep);
  await tx.completeInputsByCapacity(
    readSigner,
    ccc.fixedPointFrom(amountInCKB)
  );
  const balanceDiff =
    (await tx.getInputsCapacity(cccClient)) - tx.getOutputsCapacity();
  console.log("balanceDiff: ", balanceDiff);
  if (balanceDiff > ccc.Zero) {
    tx.addOutput({
      lock: fromScript,
    });
  }
  //await tx.completeFeeBy(readSigner, 1000);

  const txHash = await cccClient.sendTransaction(tx);
  console.log("Full transaction: ", tx.stringify());
  return txHash;
}
```

### Is the Hash_Lock Safe to Use?

The short answer is no. The `hash_lock` is not very secure for guarding your CKB tokens. Some of you might already know the reason, but here are some points to consider:

- **Miner Front-running**: Since the preimage value is revealed in the witness, once you submit the transaction to the blockchain, miners can see this preimage and construct a new transaction to transfer the tokens to their addresses before you do.
- **Balance Vulnerability**: Once you transfer part of the balance from the `hash_lock` address, the preimage value is revealed on-chain. This makes the remaining tokens locked in the `hash_lock` vulnerable since anyone who sees the preimage can steal them.

Even though using a hash and preimage is too simple to be a secure Lock Script, it’s a great starting point for learning. The goal is to understand how CKB Scripts work and gain experience with CKB development.

## Congratulations!

By following this tutorial, you've mastered the basics of building a custom lock and a full-stack dApp on CKB. Here's a quick recap:

- We built a custom Lock Script to guard CKB tokens.
- We built a dApp frontend to transfer/unlock tokens from this Lock Script.
- We explored the limitations and vulnerabilities of our naive Lock Script design.

## Next Step

So now your dApp works great on the local blockchain, you might want to switch it to different environments like Testnet and Mainnet.

To do that, just change the environment variable `NETWORK` to `testnet` in the `.env` file:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet # devnet, testnet or mainnet
```
