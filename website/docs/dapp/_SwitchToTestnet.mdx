After your app is tested and works fine on the local blockchain, you might want to switch it to different environments like Testnet and mainnet.

Since we are using [Lumos] as Dapp framework, the management for different chains is in lumos config file.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/docs.nervos.org.git
cd docs.nervos.org.git/examples/<example-name>
yarn && yarn start
```
