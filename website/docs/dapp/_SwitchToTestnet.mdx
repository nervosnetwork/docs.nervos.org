So now your dApp works great on the local blockchain, you might want to switch it to different environments like Testnet and Mainnet.

To do that, just change the environment variable `NETWORK` to `testnet`:

```sh
export NETWORK=testnet
```

And then start the dApp again, everything should work fine and switch to the testnet.
