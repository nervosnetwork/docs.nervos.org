So now your app works great on the local blockchain, you might want to switch it to different environments like Testnet and Mainnet.

To do this, you need to update the chain config and related code. 

Open the `ckb.ts` in your project root dir, change the `lumosConfig` and `CKB_RPC_URL`:

```ts
//export const lumosConfig: config.Config = devConfig as config.Config;
export const lumosConfig = config.predefined.AGGRON4 as config.Config;

//export const CKB_RPC_URL = 'http://localhost:8114';
export const CKB_RPC_URL = "https://testnet.ckb.dev/rpc";
```

Actually, we have the corresponding Testnet version examples for all these tutorials. The source code of the Testnet version is in [https://github.com/nervosnetwork/docs.nervos.org/tree/develop/examples](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/docs.nervos.org/tree/develop/examples), you can clone the repo and start running on Testnet.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/docs.nervos.org.git
cd docs.nervos.org/examples/<example-name>
yarn && yarn start
```
